[2020/02/10, 20:01:19] Bangie: 2B||!2B ??
[2020/02/10, 20:01:23] Chloë: So if we're all coming in tomorrow, let's try and chat about it
[2020/02/10, 20:01:55] Bangie: Cool , what time ?
[2020/02/10, 20:04:34] Chloë: Whenever, I'll be there
[2020/02/10, 20:04:46] Chloë: What works for you guys?
[2020/02/10, 20:06:56] Bangie: Anytime as well
[2020/02/10, 21:47:02] Dino: Well we have the lab at 2:15 so I rate like 1 would be chilled?
‎[2020/02/10, 21:48:44] Reece: ‎GIF omitted
[2020/02/10, 21:48:53] Reece: What’s the topic of discussion though
[2020/02/10, 21:59:18] Jesse: Hokai
[2020/02/10, 22:00:40] Chloë: Probably not lunch ey
[2020/02/10, 22:01:19] Jesse: Hokai
[2020/02/10, 22:25:27] Dino: And some hacky sack too
[2020/02/10, 22:28:08] Jesse: 😂
[2020/02/10, 22:28:21] Jesse: Yes
[2020/02/11, 11:21:55] Chloë: Are you guys fine with 12:30? In WSS
[2020/02/11, 11:22:49] Philani: I won't be able to make 12:30 🙈
[2020/02/11, 11:22:54] Dino: I’ll probably be a bit later than than 🙈
[2020/02/11, 11:22:57] Dino: *that
[2020/02/11, 11:24:08] Chloë: Okay 😬 I'm gonna go and get some lunch in the lunch hour so then's probably not going to work, but if anyone is here before that/we can talk during our lab
[2020/02/11, 11:24:27] Chloë: Also we probably won't go until 5 today so we can use some of that time
[2020/02/11, 11:28:22] Philani: I'm cool with that 🙏🏾
[2020/02/11, 11:41:45] Dino: That should work ✌🏼so aren’t we gonna meet at 1?
[2020/02/11, 11:45:53] Chloë: And then I'm out at 1:15
[2020/02/11, 11:50:01] Reece: Is this thing due tomorrow?
[2020/02/11, 11:50:41] Reece: If not then it’s not that deep. We can meet tomorrow.
[2020/02/11, 11:54:37] Dino: Nah i don’t think there’s anything due any time soon
[2020/02/11, 13:14:30] Jesse: So must I be anywhere now
[2020/02/11, 13:19:37] Chloë: Doesn't seem like it lmao
[2020/02/16, 11:24:11] Chloë: K so guys what's the plan?
[2020/02/16, 11:24:29] Chloë: Are we coming in tomorrow? And do we know what project we want to do
[2020/02/16, 11:24:55] Bangie: I’ll be there tomorrow , not sure on which project but we can discuss
[2020/02/16, 11:26:30] Dino: We should probably all come in so we can discuss it ✌🏼
[2020/02/16, 11:43:39] Reece: Sounds like a plan
[2020/02/16, 11:43:40] Reece: We need to agree on a time today though
[2020/02/16, 11:43:59] Dino: 1pm?
[2020/02/16, 11:44:21] Chloë: Lunch is not a good time 🤦🏽‍♀😂 it will never be a good time
[2020/02/16, 11:44:44] Dino: Why though?😂 it’s not like we have anything during the morning on mondays
[2020/02/16, 11:45:15] Reece: Chloe I know It’s called lunch but you know you can get food at any time of the day right?
[2020/02/16, 11:45:25] Chloë: I come in early on Mondays, kind of have to since I don't drive ☹️
[2020/02/16, 11:45:42] Chloë: I'm aware
[2020/02/16, 11:47:52] Philani: I can make it then 👍🏾
[2020/02/16, 12:10:06] Reece: Same
[2020/02/16, 20:38:47] Dino: So what’s happening?
[2020/02/16, 20:42:35] Reece: We meet at 1-ish before the lab
[2020/02/16, 20:43:21] Reece: Since nobody has suggested an alternative
[2020/02/16, 20:44:00] Reece: @27790336477 don’t worry we’ll take minutes 😂
[2020/02/16, 21:06:45] Dino: Sweet 😂✌🏼
[2020/02/17, 12:29:18] Bangie: Where we meeting
[2020/02/17, 12:30:11] Chloë: Outside msl?
[2020/02/17, 12:30:28] Bangie: 1?
[2020/02/17, 12:31:35] Jesse: I might be 15 mins late then sorry guys
[2020/02/17, 12:31:40] Chloë: Yeah 1
[2020/02/17, 12:32:45] Philani: Same 🙈
[2020/02/17, 12:33:44] Dino: Same 😅
[2020/02/17, 12:34:05] Bangie: Okay so 1:15 ? 😂
[2020/02/17, 12:59:00] Chloë: 1:15 😂
[2020/02/17, 13:10:28] Jesse: Anyone here?
[2020/02/17, 13:12:37] Chloë: Coming
[2020/02/17, 18:15:25] Bangie: Guys we have to choose a scrum leader 😂
[2020/02/17, 19:27:37] Philani: What do they do again? 😂
[2020/02/17, 19:27:56] Bangie: They send the idea we want to do to Rylan 😂
[2020/02/17, 19:29:20] Philani: Okay awe 😂 I can do that, but I won't be home for a while 😂
[2020/02/18, 09:45:48] Philani: I'm gonna email the tutor later today. I'll email this order:

1. Textbook market
2. Exam schedule 
3. Student Success

Everyone chilled with that?
[2020/02/18, 09:48:13] Chloë: 👍🏼
[2020/02/18, 10:06:43] Jesse: 👍
[2020/02/18, 10:24:34] Bangie: Leader Philani 🔥
[2020/02/18, 10:57:55] Dino: Perfect thanks man ✌🏼
[2020/02/18, 12:45:27] Philani: I think I need student numbers. Can everyone please send theirs through ✌🏾
[2020/02/18, 12:45:43] Bangie: 1828201

[2020/02/18, 13:08:45] ‎Dino changed the group description
[2020/02/18, 13:08:58] Dino: Everyone just add it to the description because we might need it often
[2020/02/18, 13:09:45] Philani: Yeah that's a good idea
[2020/02/18, 13:09:57] ‎Philani changed the group description
[2020/02/18, 13:11:14] ‎You changed the group description

[2020/02/18, 21:38:20] Philani: Can you guys please post the picture of the page Richard wrote on 🙏🏾
‎[2020/02/18, 21:49:46] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/02/18, 21:57:11] Philani: Thanks 👍🏾
[2020/02/18, 21:57:23] Reece: Anything for you Philani
[2020/02/18, 21:57:28] Reece: *anything*
[2020/02/18, 21:58:02] Philani: You got R100?
[2020/02/18, 21:58:49] Reece: 🙈
[2020/02/18, 21:59:46] Philani: Shaaaappppp 😂
‎[2020/02/19, 17:43:16] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/02/19, 17:46:52] Dino: Dope ✌🏼
[2020/02/19, 17:46:57] Dino: Which project though?
[2020/02/19, 17:53:06] Bangie: Guys I’m gonna go watch some videos on github so we can know how to setup our repository when the time comes by
[2020/02/19, 18:43:44] Reece: What a champ
[2020/02/19, 18:44:54] Dino: Awe thanks dude, please send the links for the best videos ✌🏼
[2020/02/19, 18:45:06] Bangie: Will do bro
[2020/02/19, 19:53:27] Philani: I just submitted the 3. I think we'll find out tomorrow which one we get.
[2020/02/19, 19:53:35] Philani: Legend 😌
[2020/02/19, 19:53:59] Reece: We don’t get to decide?
[2020/02/19, 19:54:51] Philani: I don't think so.
[2020/02/19, 19:55:27] Philani: Cause you have to submit 3, right? So I think they allocate so that one lecture doesn't have like 4 groups and another has none.
[2020/02/19, 19:55:45] Reece: Fair
[2020/02/19, 20:34:10] Dino: Awe ✌🏼
‎[2020/02/22, 08:12:08] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/02/22, 08:12:50] Bangie: Shit 💔
[2020/02/22, 08:13:31] Philani: Yeah it sucks. But, I rate we just choose the graph marking one, since we were talking about that one as well.
[2020/02/22, 08:13:41] Bangie: Yeah I guess so
[2020/02/22, 08:34:12] Chloë: Awful ☹️
[2020/02/22, 10:12:38] Dino: Could we not just do our own project?😂
[2020/02/22, 10:31:50] Reece: Who decided that our group would be the one to not get our pick
[2020/02/22, 10:32:01] Reece: Total bullshit
[2020/02/22, 10:32:18] Reece: We should speak to them about this
[2020/02/22, 10:34:07] Chloë: Probably the fact that we took so long to decide
[2020/02/22, 10:35:03] Dino: That’s so shitty though. I don’t want to spend a whole year doing something that’s not what we wanna do
[2020/02/22, 10:35:59] Reece: I recall our lecturer saying that we should come speak to him if we have our own idea
[2020/02/22, 10:36:10] Reece: I rate we think of one and do that
[2020/02/22, 10:36:52] Philani: It's probably this tbh.
[2020/02/22, 10:37:07] Dino: I agree. The other thing that might be a challenge is not having a client to make the software for, like our sense of direction won’t be as clear
[2020/02/22, 10:37:32] Philani: So I submitted the graph marking one just so we can have something submitted. And we'll move from there.
[2020/02/22, 10:37:42] Philani: Yeah exactly.
[2020/02/22, 10:38:00] Reece: Maybe we’ll still be assigned one 🤷🏽‍♂
[2020/02/22, 10:38:10] Reece: Bro wtf
[2020/02/22, 10:38:13] Dino: Awe ✌🏼
[2020/02/22, 10:38:40] Philani: If we take any longer we'll get left with Android Marking. And we didn't even consider that one.
[2020/02/22, 10:39:12] Reece: Okay fair
[2020/02/22, 10:39:25] Dino: Facts. Maybe also just email him and say that we’re gonna come up with our own one rather
[2020/02/22, 10:40:15] Reece: I’m sure he’ll understand if we explain that we don’t feel excited about the choices at hand
[2020/02/22, 10:40:55] Dino: Yeah I really hope so. Because a year long project isn’t something we wanna do for the sake of it you know?
[2020/02/22, 10:41:19] Philani: I'll do that later then 👍🏾 also, we don't even really have a new idea, though 😅
[2020/02/22, 10:41:39] Reece: Emergency meeting on Monday?
[2020/02/22, 10:41:53] Reece: Then everyone think about ideas between today and tomorrow
[2020/02/22, 10:42:14] Dino: Yeah definitely 🙏🏼😃
[2020/02/24, 09:58:14] Chloë: When are we meeting today?
[2020/02/24, 09:59:56] Philani: Lunch?
[2020/02/24, 10:00:28] Chloë: Is anyone going to be here before that?
[2020/02/24, 10:01:37] Bangie: I am
[2020/02/24, 10:04:51] Chloë: So do you guys think we could meet before lunch then?
[2020/02/24, 10:07:35] Philani: I could come earlier, but not sure of everyone else 😂😅
[2020/02/24, 10:09:25] Chloë: Yeah hey 😂

[2020/02/24, 10:13:04] Chloë: So lunch then?
[2020/02/24, 10:13:35] Bangie: Sure
[2020/02/24, 10:16:19] Jesse: I will only be able to get to wits at about 13h30 I think guys
[2020/02/24, 10:16:51] Chloë: That should be fine, I rate even at that time we'll barely have gotten anything done
[2020/02/24, 10:17:19] Jesse: 😂
[2020/02/24, 10:17:26] Chloë: We're just chatting about what we want to do if not the graph marker, no work to do yet
[2020/02/24, 10:17:38] Jesse: Ah okay
[2020/02/24, 10:17:46] Jesse: I'm happy with any choice
[2020/02/24, 10:20:53] Philani: I thought that we were gonna decide what new project we wanna do.
[2020/02/24, 10:21:09] Chloë: That's what I'm saying
[2020/02/24, 10:21:18] Philani: Awe 😂
[2020/02/24, 10:21:31] Chloë: But it has to be good for them to let us do it instead of the marker
[2020/02/24, 12:31:41] Chloë: Guys I'm not feeling too well, won't be able to make it. My vote is to stick with the graph marker (we were kind of keen for it anyway) unless someone has a super cool idea (which I don't 🤣)
[2020/02/24, 13:01:52] Philani: You guys here?
[2020/02/24, 13:09:01] Dino: Yeah walking down now ✌🏼
[2020/02/24, 13:16:06] Jesse: Where we meeting
[2020/02/24, 13:18:12] Philani: Stands
[2020/02/24, 13:18:18] Philani: Like the beginning
[2020/02/24, 14:53:30] Dino: Everyone create a github account and send your username
[2020/02/24, 14:55:58] Chloë: 👍
[2020/02/24, 14:59:33] Chloë: cds21199
‎[2020/02/24, 17:00:05] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/02/24, 17:19:39] Philani: It's so disrespectful that they email you saying it doesn't work 😂
[2020/02/24, 17:19:45] Philani: Like we already like that 😂
[2020/02/24, 18:22:34] Jesse: 😂😂
[2020/02/24, 20:23:59] Philani: Hey guys, I'll email Pravesh now to set up a meeting later this week. So I think this is what we need to do before next week.

1. Make sure that we can all push, pull, commit and track changes on Github.

2. Have proof of Scrum Meetings (WhatsApp messages) as well as minutes of our meeting with Pravesh which we put on the Wiki tab in Github.

3. A document with documented user stories and backlog made using Taiga (which we'll get help from Pravesh).

4. A Software Architecture Design (not too sure what that is), which we put on the Wiki on Github.

5. Fix the Circle CI and Coverall Badges on our Github (Make sure to have a percentage).
[2020/02/24, 20:24:40] Philani: I know it seems like a lot, but I don't think it really is. It seems like it's just mainly setting stuff up. I think once we've met with Pravesh it'll all be a lot clearer 👍🏾
[2020/02/24, 20:25:10] Chloë: Awesome 👍🏼
[2020/02/24, 20:25:46] Jesse: Thanka Philani
[2020/02/24, 20:25:51] Jesse: Thanks *
[2020/02/24, 20:33:06] Philani: No stress ✌🏾
[2020/02/24, 20:33:44] Jesse: We're gonna code in Java yea?
[2020/02/24, 20:33:50] Philani: Yea.
[2020/02/24, 20:39:14] Jesse: Okay cool
[2020/02/24, 20:41:05] Philani: And I've just emailed Pravesh to meet up, I'll let you guys know what he says.
[2020/02/24, 20:41:35] Chloë: Thanks Philani 😌
[2020/02/24, 21:04:37] Bangie: Guys I know this might be a dumb question but can I get a Laptop that runs on Linux ?
[2020/02/24, 21:05:38] Philani: What do you mean? Like you buy it and it has linux already installed?
[2020/02/24, 21:05:47] Bangie: Yeah
[2020/02/24, 21:06:21] Bangie: Because my current computer only has like 40gb of space left
[2020/02/24, 21:06:57] Philani: I'm not too sure. But I'm sure if you check out a place they could do it for you
[2020/02/24, 21:07:45] Bangie: Do you think that store at the matrix would know 😂
[2020/02/24, 21:08:32] Philani: Yeah, probably 😂
[2020/02/24, 21:09:09] Bangie: Okay lovely I’ll check tomorrow
[2020/02/24, 21:09:12] Bangie: Thanks bro
[2020/02/24, 21:09:11] Reece: Bro you can just install Linux
[2020/02/24, 21:09:37] Reece: As in take a laptop that runs on windows... download Linux and install it to overwrite windows
[2020/02/24, 21:10:18] Bangie: Yeahh
[2020/02/24, 23:12:52] Dino: Dope thanks so much bro 🙏🏼
[2020/02/24, 23:14:05] Dino: To make sure that we can all push/pull to GitHub, everyone add a print line with their name to the Test project Program.java

Mine and Bangie’s are there so you’ll see what I’m talking about
[2020/02/24, 23:14:39] Jesse: Good idea
[2020/02/25, 11:02:52] Reece: We gonna link up today?
[2020/02/25, 11:03:02] Chloë: We should
[2020/02/25, 11:16:13] Dino: What do we need to do?
[2020/02/25, 11:17:13] Chloë: Chat about whatever this software architecture design thing is, and chat about some strategy/who can do what
[2020/02/25, 11:17:27] Chloë: Just high level stuff right now before we talk to Pravesh
[2020/02/25, 11:17:59] Reece: When is our meeting with Pravzo, actually
[2020/02/25, 11:28:18] Philani: Pravesh still hasn't gotten back to me
[2020/02/25, 11:28:40] Philani: I thought he'd have at least responded to this email, seeing that the thing we're making is for him 😂
[2020/02/25, 11:33:17] Bangie: You want to message him on WhatsApp
[2020/02/25, 11:33:37] Philani: Are we even allowed to do that? 😂
[2020/02/25, 11:34:05] Bangie: Ehh min 😂
[2020/02/25, 11:58:20] Chloë: So do you guys want to meet? Maybe lunch time
[2020/02/25, 12:02:41] Dino: I can probably get there by like 1:45
[2020/02/25, 12:02:43] Philani: I don't know if I'll make it 🙈
[2020/02/25, 12:03:04] Philani: I'll probably only get there by then top tbh
[2020/02/25, 12:03:08] Philani: too*
[2020/02/25, 12:11:02] Chloë: Alrighty then😁
[2020/02/25, 12:12:15] Dino: In the meanwhile everybody needs to figure out the GitHub stuff so you can push and pull
[2020/02/25, 13:40:49] Dino: Are we meeting?
[2020/02/25, 13:41:10] Philani: I'm getting into Wits
[2020/02/25, 13:41:34] Chloë: I'm in the laptop room if anyone's here
[2020/02/25, 13:58:44] Jesse: Sorry guys I'm coming
[2020/02/25, 13:58:57] Dino: So we are meeting?
[2020/02/25, 13:59:06] Bangie: Okay I’m coming
[2020/02/25, 13:59:25] Philani: Chloe and I are in the laptop area.
[2020/02/25, 14:08:17] Philani: Goolam, do you mind messaging Pravesh cause he's not answering me 😂

[2020/02/26, 11:11:24] Philani: Yeah, drop the link 😂
[2020/02/26, 11:11:31] Jesse: google how to clone github repository to <Your IDE)>
[2020/02/26, 11:12:03] Jesse: Then how to commit/push project from <Your IDE> to github
[2020/02/26, 11:12:20] Jesse: But if you choose a good vid it'll show you how to do both
[2020/02/26, 12:00:49] Chloë: Guys who's here
[2020/02/26, 12:03:02] Chloë: Cause Pravesh is at his office
[2020/02/26, 12:26:21] Philani: I'm on my way
[2020/02/26, 12:26:29] Chloë: Okay cool
[2020/02/26, 12:29:37] Reece: Meeting room bro
[2020/02/26, 12:29:40] Reece: He’s here already
[2020/02/26, 12:31:00] Jesse: Where is his office
[2020/02/26, 12:32:04] Jesse: I'm just getting into wits
[2020/02/26, 12:38:58] Chloë: UG, we're in the meeting room

[2020/02/26, 12:44:10] Jesse: Oh
[2020/02/26, 18:31:34] Chloë: Okay yall should I just email this thing?
[2020/02/26, 18:31:55] Chloë: I straight up had it done and fell asleep without sending it 🤦🏽‍♀
[2020/02/26, 18:32:32] Dino: That’s perfect ✌🏼 thanks Chloe
[2020/02/26, 18:32:44] Chloë: 👍
[2020/02/26, 18:32:52] Dino: Guys please just all set up the Github by tonight 🙏🏼
[2020/02/26, 18:49:03] Bangie: What else do we have to do
[2020/02/26, 18:49:20] Bangie: The taiga shit?
[2020/02/26, 19:22:59] Philani: Thanks Chloe
[2020/02/26, 19:23:08] Philani: What actually is Taiga? 😂
[2020/02/26, 21:45:00] Dino: It’s some sort of calendar
[2020/02/26, 21:46:03] Dino: Reece you still haven’t pushed your name to the repository 🙄
[2020/02/26, 21:47:17] Reece: You are correct
[2020/02/26, 21:47:30] Reece: I went straight from campus to tutoring to gym
[2020/02/26, 21:47:38] Reece: And boy I’m tired
[2020/02/26, 21:47:52] Reece: I will do it tomorrow
[2020/02/26, 21:48:04] Reece: now*
[2020/02/26, 21:49:22] Dino: It will take like 10 minutes. You’ve had enough time
[2020/02/26, 21:58:16] Philani: We'll set it up tomorrow. We don't have dates so I think we just need to have it up.
[2020/02/26, 21:59:00] Dino: 🙏🏼
[2020/02/26, 22:46:31] Reece: _you’ve had enough time_ 😂
[2020/02/26, 22:47:45] Reece: Dino _aSASStasopolous_
[2020/02/26, 22:48:38] Dino: Okay Reece?😂 
All you did in the lab was play minesweeper, and now you’re behind
[2020/02/26, 22:49:18] Reece: Go check the repository pls 🙄😂
[2020/02/26, 22:49:40] Reece: No regrets whatsoever... got a 16 second run out of that shit
[2020/02/26, 22:50:26] Dino: Now was it that difficult? Sorry that now you’re up past your bed time but thank you 😉
[2020/02/26, 22:51:07] Reece: No problem
[2020/02/27, 08:00:22] Dino: Is anyone planning to go to FLA?
[2020/02/27, 08:02:35] Chloë: Hahahahahahahaha no
[2020/02/27, 08:10:05] Philani: I might 😂🙈
[2020/02/27, 08:25:03] Bangie: Do we just have taiga left to do ?
[2020/02/27, 08:26:43] Philani: I think so.

[2020/02/27, 17:42:48] Bangie: Yeah but that will be on the calendar
[2020/02/27, 17:43:02] Bangie: So who else wants to attempt doing the taiga thing
[2020/02/27, 19:57:23] Philani: Eish I was gonna volunteer. I just got home, though 😂🙈
[2020/02/27, 20:23:37] Bangie: I didn’t do it 😂
[2020/02/27, 20:50:44] Dino: Sorry man just got home from soccer 😂
[2020/02/27, 20:51:35] Dino: Jesse, Reece, you guys willing to? Philani, Bangie and I did the GitHub, CircleCI and Coveralls thing and Chloe did the notes from the meeting ✌🏼
[2020/02/27, 21:35:57] Reece: Totally understandable
[2020/02/27, 21:40:21] Reece: I am, however, currently in the process of packing ... which will probably continue into tomorrow, and then the weekend I’m moving. Plus I haven’t done the CGV or ML labs yet so any time I get in between imma still have to do that.
[2020/02/27, 21:47:10] Jesse: Okay cool
[2020/02/27, 21:47:16] Jesse: Not now though
[2020/02/27, 21:47:40] Bangie: Just before Monday though
[2020/02/27, 21:48:01] Bangie: I’m gonna try and do it tomorrow on my own repository just to see if I do it right
[2020/02/27, 21:50:35] Reece: Jesse if you’re gonna be at campus early tomorrow we could meet up and try and get it done before our lecture?
[2020/02/27, 21:51:38] Dino: I understand that bro but just try manage your time and you’ll be alright 🙏🏼 CGV won’t take too long, and maybe for ML just copy the code from the pictures for now so you have something and then try go through it and figure it out if you get the chance
[2020/02/27, 21:55:27] Jesse: Okay I'll try my best dude. I'm really suck at waking up early but I'll try!
[2020/02/27, 21:55:33] Jesse: I*
[2020/02/27, 22:10:01] Dino: You got this bro. It’s one day, take one for the team 😏
[2020/02/27, 22:10:23] Jesse: xD
[2020/02/27, 22:10:24] Jesse: I got this
[2020/02/27, 23:08:38] Jesse: what time should I be in?
[2020/02/27, 23:08:42] Jesse: before 8?
[2020/02/28, 07:50:17] Bangie: https://youtu.be/0kPRaYSgblM
[2020/02/28, 08:42:33] Philani: Thanks Goolam 🙏🏾
[2020/02/28, 09:36:14] Bangie: What were we supposed to add to the wiki page and backlog page on taiga
[2020/02/28, 09:41:59] Jesse: Dino I think I need you need to sign in to github to set this up because you created the repository
[2020/02/28, 09:42:53] Bangie: And the user stories are on taiga so we can create them there

[2020/02/28, 09:54:27] Bangie: What’s this for Jesse
[2020/02/28, 09:57:41] Jesse: Setting up taiga with github
[2020/02/28, 09:58:12] Jesse: These instructions are used on github
[2020/02/28, 10:04:36] Jesse: I shared a google doc with the Taiga sign in info with all of you
[2020/02/28, 10:06:51] Bangie: Check this owe ❤️
[2020/02/28, 10:07:06] Jesse: 😂😂😂
[2020/02/28, 10:09:29] Dino: Awe thanks bro ✌🏼😏
[2020/02/28, 16:21:06] Bangie: Jesse the taiga thing is setup ?
[2020/02/28, 16:27:12] Dino: I linked the taiga onto GitHub

[2020/02/28, 16:58:19] Jesse: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/02/28, 16:58:32] Jesse: Is there anything else I just do for taiga?
[2020/02/28, 16:58:53] Jesse: Must*
[2020/02/28, 16:59:30] Dino: Jesse bro I’m sorry but I think I kinda messed over your taiga 🙄 because you created a “SoftwareDesignProject” profile with your name and email address and sent this stuff. But then when I went into taiga it just said I must login with GitHub and link the project so now it’s a bit weird
[2020/02/28, 17:00:16] Jesse: Fuck 😂😂😂
[2020/02/28, 17:00:50] Bangie: I managed to join your one though
[2020/02/28, 17:00:45] Jesse: What should we do?
[2020/02/28, 17:00:47] Dino: But maybe just go to your profile and change the username to your name rather than software design project 😂
‎[2020/02/28, 17:01:21] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/02/28, 17:01:36] Dino: Yeah I saw it ✌🏼 I added all your email addresses. It seems like the thing is kinda set up
[2020/02/28, 17:01:52] Dino: I rate everyone just add a random bullshit user story with a due date and shit so we can see if we’re linked
[2020/02/28, 17:01:55] Bangie: So we need to do this
[2020/02/28, 17:02:28] Bangie: Okay I’m only gonna be home tonight so can I do it then
[2020/02/28, 17:03:11] Dino: sweet no rush ✌🏼
‎[2020/02/29, 13:03:22] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/02/29, 14:36:47] Dino: Maybe you first have to run the under function?
[2020/02/29, 14:38:36] Dino: Yo guys I know you don’t care, but just for the purpose of the scrum meeting proof shit. Just wanted to let you know that I won’t be available until tomorrow afternoon sometime, gonna be jolling at ultra 😜
[2020/02/29, 15:57:29] Jesse: Have fun bro 🙏
[2020/02/29, 16:00:42] Dino: Thanks man ❤
[2020/02/29, 16:00:50] Philani: Yeah man 🙏🏾
[2020/03/01, 13:13:01] Bangie: Guys I created the user story
[2020/03/01, 13:18:28] Philani: Awe, thanks bro 🙏🏾
[2020/03/01, 13:29:41] Bangie: Who submitted ML
[2020/03/01, 14:47:44] Philani: I've submitted
[2020/03/01, 20:16:43] Dino: So have we finished everything for tomorrow?
[2020/03/01, 20:17:34] Chloë: 4 and 5 I'm not 100 percent sure of but everything else looks fine
[2020/03/01, 20:20:31] Bangie: What time must we meet up so we can go through the rubric ?
[2020/03/01, 20:20:56] Bangie: There’s some YouTube videos that show you how to make a drag and drop UI
[2020/03/01, 20:22:30] Reece: Awe sorry I’ve been pretty indisposed this weekend guys
[2020/03/01, 20:23:05] Philani: Like to just make sure we have everything done? I think early enough to make sure we can fix everything before. So like 12 should be fine, right?
[2020/03/01, 20:23:13] Reece: Is there anything I need to sign up for/set up before tomorrow ?
[2020/03/01, 20:23:17] Bangie: Yeah bro that’s perfect
[2020/03/01, 20:23:37] Bangie: Go on to your email and there’s a link to join taiga
[2020/03/01, 20:23:42] Bangie: Then add a user story to it
[2020/03/01, 20:24:03] Reece: Awe
[2020/03/01, 20:24:16] Reece: That’s it?
[2020/03/01, 20:24:29] Bangie: Yeah the rest we’ll go throug tomorrow
[2020/03/01, 20:24:44] Bangie: I think there’s some documentation we need to add to the wiki part on taiga
[2020/03/01, 20:28:49] Philani: So everyone chilled with 12 tomorrow?
[2020/03/01, 20:51:26] Chloë: I might be just a little bit later than that but that should be fine 👍🏼
[2020/03/01, 20:52:16] Bangie: I’ll be there from 8 for anyone who’s there early 😂
[2020/03/01, 20:52:50] Chloë: If anyone else will be there at 8 then I'm good with that too
[2020/03/01, 21:01:37] Philani: I won't be there by then 🙈
[2020/03/01, 21:02:55] Dino: Yeah I will be able to get there earliest 12 😂
[2020/03/01, 21:03:35] Bangie: Hungover 😂😂😂
[2020/03/01, 21:05:05] Dino: Nah nah 😂 I have an appointment at 9:30 and need to go home afterwards
[2020/03/01, 21:05:43] Bangie: Ayy that alcohol fucked you over so bad 😂
[2020/03/01, 21:06:01] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/03/01, 21:11:31] Dino: 😂😂
[2020/03/02, 09:28:12] Bangie: Who installed anaconda
[2020/03/02, 09:47:21] Philani: I have on Windows.
[2020/03/02, 09:55:50] Chloë: Same
[2020/03/02, 10:02:40] Dino: Same. Gave up on the dual boot. Just gonna use the windows Ubuntu terminal
[2020/03/02, 10:50:19] Bangie: I'm not sure, they've been super vague about that... I'm hoping they're lenient with that...
I think in your wiki just describe what your project is supposed to do and what it can currently do
[2020/03/02, 10:50:41] Chloë: Cool cool cool
[2020/03/02, 10:51:31] Bangie: What else do we need to do ??
[2020/03/02, 10:52:25] Chloë: What's number 5? Not sure what needs/needed to be done there
[2020/03/02, 10:52:54] Bangie: What is number 5?
[2020/03/02, 10:53:21] Chloë: Tap on the message I replied to
[2020/03/02, 10:54:17] Bangie: I think this is done already , didn’t we do this Dino
[2020/03/02, 10:57:46] Dino: I think so, but there’s no percentages
[2020/03/02, 10:57:57] Philani: We can figure it out when we meet up, but I think it's been done.
[2020/03/02, 10:58:56] Bangie: Percentages just show how much of our code is being covered by coveralls
[2020/03/02, 10:59:01] Bangie: At this point there’s nothing
[2020/03/02, 10:59:14] Dino: Yeah that’s what I thought too
[2020/03/02, 10:59:45] Bangie: If we were doing a web application we could’ve used Django
[2020/03/02, 11:30:16] Bangie: We meeting at 12 or 12:30?
[2020/03/02, 11:30:31] Philani: 12
[2020/03/02, 11:34:08] Dino: ✌🏼
[2020/03/02, 11:34:19] Dino: I’m leaving home now so will be there just after 12
[2020/03/02, 11:51:31] Philani: I'm in the laptop area if anyone's here already 👍🏾
[2020/03/02, 12:22:25] Philani: @27790336477 and @27832807296 where are you guys?
[2020/03/02, 12:22:38] Chloë: Coming
[2020/03/02, 16:28:47] Bangie: Guys how about we create the application with all the tests first and worry about the moodle plug in later ?
[2020/03/02, 16:29:11] Bangie: Because all these tutors are worried about is user stories
[2020/03/02, 17:40:49] Bangie: Guys I found a drag and drop thing but it’s in HTML
[2020/03/02, 17:50:09] Philani: We could do that. But didn't Pravesh say that he wanted the plugin first?
[2020/03/02, 17:50:19] Philani: I'm sure we can still use it.
[2020/03/02, 17:50:35] Chloë: Nothing stops us from being proactive 🤷🏽‍♀
[2020/03/02, 17:51:13] Chloë: Also, with the amount of time we have I'm sure we can research integrating html into a program of a different language
[2020/03/02, 17:51:28] Dino: I feel like it makes more sense to get the plugin working first
[2020/03/02, 17:51:32] Dino: Agreed ✌🏼
[2020/03/02, 17:51:39] Dino: Or else we can just find one for java
[2020/03/02, 17:52:05] Bangie: Like hear me out right if we do the app first and then worry about the plugin afterwards then we can fulfill this shit about user stories
[2020/03/02, 17:53:35] Chloë: Oh for sure
[2020/03/02, 17:54:25] Bangie: Because these idiots don’t realize our app has very little user stories
[2020/03/02, 17:54:41] Dino: Hmm I get that, but I think we can still do the user stories without coding the shit
[2020/03/02, 17:55:02] Bangie: No but like he wants to see code related to it
[2020/03/02, 17:55:31] Bangie: I think we can do this as a web based app so we don’t have to convert HTML to like java
[2020/03/02, 17:57:12] Bangie: I’m gonna try and do a login and signup on HTML now
[2020/03/02, 17:58:33] Philani: Isn't this all on Moodle, though? Or are you doing it just for them, then we go back and use Moodle after?
[2020/03/02, 17:59:34] Chloë: I don't think Moodle specifies a language though
[2020/03/02, 17:59:40] Chloë: For plugins
[2020/03/02, 18:00:07] Bangie: Yeah it doesn’t a plug-in is just like the actual thing running on moodle
[2020/03/02, 18:00:13] Bangie: So it could be a text file even

[2020/03/02, 18:15:59] Chloë: I think I linked the moodle plugin stuff in the user story I posted too 🤷🏽‍♀
[2020/03/02, 18:16:32] Bangie: Have you linked it already ???
[2020/03/02, 18:16:58] Chloë: No just a link to the tutorial
[2020/03/02, 18:17:19] Chloë: That page also has links to php tutorials you might need to get started
[2020/03/03, 09:08:44] Bangie: Guys did you get 0.9 for the final test accuracy
[2020/03/03, 09:09:23] Philani: Me and Dino got 0.89
[2020/03/03, 09:10:42] Bangie: For 3 ? Or 2?
[2020/03/03, 09:11:10] Philani: For 3
[2020/03/03, 09:11:19] Bangie: And for the rest you got 1?
[2020/03/03, 09:11:52] Bangie: Please check for me again if you got it
[2020/03/03, 09:12:02] Philani: Yeah
‎[2020/03/03, 10:25:34] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/03, 10:27:18] Bangie: You did it already 😂
[2020/03/03, 10:27:26] Bangie: The shape choice
[2020/03/03, 10:27:57] Philani: Oh flip I'm just being silly 😂🤦🏾‍♂ awe 👍🏾
[2020/03/03, 20:12:31] Dino: Are we gonna meet tomorrow?
[2020/03/03, 20:16:01] Philani: I'm down.
[2020/03/03, 20:21:21] Dino: Straight after the lecture? I don’t feel like waiting around
[2020/03/03, 20:22:06] Philani: Yeah that's cool 👍🏾
[2020/03/03, 20:22:21] Philani: If you've got tuition we can just let you guys know.
[2020/03/03, 20:41:56] Chloë: I'm tutoring at 10 ☝🏼
[2020/03/03, 21:27:30] Reece: Awe I’m there
[2020/03/04, 09:05:44] Jesse: Sorry guys I don't think I'll make to wits by that time
[2020/03/04, 09:15:03] Chloë: So are you guys going to meet at 1ish? I might have to leave at 12. But I'll keep you guys updated
[2020/03/04, 09:15:46] Chloë: Also, I'll start working on the initial moodle plugin so we have something ready when we have the server environment set up
[2020/03/04, 09:17:42] Bangie: Ive done a login thing more or less with HTML
[2020/03/04, 09:18:14] Bangie: I spoke to Rylan and the tests he wrote were in JavaScript
[2020/03/04, 09:18:39] Bangie: And I sort of have an understanding now of the circle ci and coveralls shit
[2020/03/04, 09:44:23] Dino: I thought we were gonna meet right now?
[2020/03/04, 09:44:52] Chloë: I'm tutoring
[2020/03/04, 09:45:20] Chloë: But that's cool though, just let me know what you guys talk about
[2020/03/04, 12:25:13] Bangie: Guys what do we need to do for this sprint
[2020/03/04, 12:31:28] Chloë: I was gonna suggest:

Clean up user stories to reflect lecturer and student stories

In one of the student USs, have the moodle plugin be a subtask

Talk to Richard about the server set up
[2020/03/04, 12:32:00] Dino: That sounds good to me 🙏🏼
[2020/03/04, 12:32:15] Bangie: Are we gonna use JavaScript ?
[2020/03/04, 12:32:33] Bangie: I’m gonna email Ryland to see the code oh how to test
[2020/03/04, 12:39:03] Chloë: 🤷🏽‍♀ we'll use whatever we can get to work
[2020/03/04, 12:39:38] Bangie: Okay cool
[2020/03/04, 15:15:39] Philani: Looks about right.
[2020/03/04, 15:16:30] Philani: Also guys I was gonna suggest that Monday before SD be the day we all meet up for this project. It seems like a day where we can all make it, seeing that we have to be here anyway for the lab later.
[2020/03/04, 15:19:39] Dino: I agree with that. I think we need to have a solid meeting every week so we can actually progress, because I think everyone’s kinda lost about what we have to do. If we meet from 1 until the lab ✌🏼
[2020/03/04, 15:23:19] Bangie: Plus for the labs we can do shit in the labs
[2020/03/04, 15:23:27] Bangie: Like the labs are useless
[2020/03/04, 15:35:21] Chloë: That's good with me
[2020/03/04, 15:51:26] Jesse: What must I get done guys
[2020/03/04, 16:32:15] Bangie: Are we gonna discuss what needs to be done by who , this week
[2020/03/04, 16:48:42] Reece: Chloe done had that whole ass meeting in her head without us 🙌🏾👏🏾😂
[2020/03/04, 17:05:35] Philani: We can
[2020/03/04, 17:07:08] Bangie: Perfect
[2020/03/04, 17:42:44] Bangie: Guys are we gonna create the draggable interface this semester or just have like an input for the nodes
[2020/03/04, 18:01:20] Philani: I think we'd have to ask Pravesh about that.
[2020/03/04, 18:02:40] Dino: 👆🏻
[2020/03/04, 19:59:01] Chloë: I think he specifically wanted that for now though, and the extension for it to be used with any algorithm was the extra thing
[2020/03/04, 20:14:13] Bangie: There’s not a lot of IDEs that support user dropping and dragging in java
[2020/03/04, 20:14:21] Bangie: I’m not sure if android studio supports it
[2020/03/04, 20:43:43] Chloë: We'll have to make it happen 🤷🏽‍♀ that's basically the whole thing he wanted, cause he wants something visual
[2020/03/04, 20:47:28] Bangie: Okay cool but what are we gonna do about these tutors , because they failing to understand that we don’t have user stories at this time because that will come at the end 😂
[2020/03/04, 20:58:10] Dino: What if instead of drag and drop, we try this. The user selects how many children there are. So let’s say from the root they say “2”, then they click on the first child and select how many children that node has, and then the same for the second child, and so on. That way we can control the visual aspect by adding stuff the way we want
[2020/03/04, 21:00:15] Bangie: And we could just make the nodes themselves like text boxes and like when they press on the node , it allows them to enter value and number of children ?
[2020/03/04, 21:01:48] Dino: That would work 🙏🏼 or, they click on a node to select it as the parents and then on the side there’s a text box with a plus sign next to it, which when clicked adds a child with the value in the text box
[2020/03/04, 21:02:55] Bangie: Sounds like a plan , when we meeting again ?
[2020/03/04, 21:05:24] Philani: We can meet during CGV, but I think best time is Monday before SD.
[2020/03/04, 21:05:31] Philani: Also we need to talk to Richard on Friday.
[2020/03/05, 07:51:29] Dino: Good idea 👍🏻
[2020/03/06, 08:21:15] Chloë: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
[2020/03/06, 08:21:44] Chloë: Just a possibly useful link
[2020/03/06, 08:21:59] Bangie: Are we meeting Richard today ??
[2020/03/06, 08:22:26] Chloë: We *should* be, what's the plan?
[2020/03/06, 08:23:14] Bangie: Don’t we have to book a meeting with him or do we just go ?
[2020/03/06, 08:23:22] Jesse: What time?
[2020/03/06, 08:23:34] Jesse: Thanks
[2020/03/06, 08:24:54] Chloë: Well it shouldn't have to be a long thing anyway, maybe 5 min to just ask him about what we need
[2020/03/06, 08:29:39] Philani: We can just ask him in the break during the lecture.
[2020/03/06, 08:30:01] Chloë: Sounds like a plan
[2020/03/06, 11:10:46] Chloë: ‎This message was deleted.
[2020/03/06, 11:11:09] Chloë: Scrum leader, will you lead us to a break
[2020/03/06, 12:21:48] Bangie: Guys when we meeting again?
[2020/03/06, 12:25:08] Chloë: Monday my dudes
[2020/03/06, 12:25:33] Bangie: And we discussing like everything ?
[2020/03/06, 12:28:29] Chloë: Yup, let's work on our individual things this weekend though so we have some progress
[2020/03/06, 12:28:41] Chloë: I'm gonna work on setting up a moodle plugin
[2020/03/06, 12:28:48] Bangie: What’s the individual things ?
[2020/03/06, 12:29:05] Bangie: I don’t mind drawing up those diagrams like activity diagrams and class diagrams
[2020/03/06, 12:33:20] Chloë: I think at this stage everyone can just pick a thing 🤷🏽‍♀ til the things to be done are done
[2020/03/06, 12:33:26] Chloë: That would be great
[2020/03/06, 12:33:39] Chloë: And then everyone else can just come up with some proposed user stories
[2020/03/06, 12:34:09] Chloë: Just one or two, so we can clean that up and then add subtasks on Monday
[2020/03/06, 12:36:32] Bangie: Okay so I’ll do the activity diagram , class diagrams and state machine diagrams
‎[2020/03/06, 12:53:27] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/06, 12:54:18] Chloë: Thanks dude 🔥
[2020/03/06, 13:19:22] Bangie: Guys so each sprint we must associate like some graphs that we gonna do
[2020/03/06, 13:19:58] Philani: Like just one?
[2020/03/06, 13:21:55] Bangie: Decide not associate 😂
[2020/03/06, 13:22:41] Bangie: So like for sprint 3 we can do graph coloring and something else depending on Pravesh
‎[2020/03/06, 15:53:22] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/06, 15:53:41] Dino: 👍🏻
[2020/03/06, 16:03:05] Bangie: Do we all have to do this
[2020/03/06, 16:19:40] Philani: I was about to forward it to everyone 😂🙈 glad I don't have to now😂
[2020/03/06, 16:19:56] Philani: Awe 👍🏾
[2020/03/06, 16:21:22] Philani: I don't think so. But we all need to know how to access it.
[2020/03/07, 17:03:47] Bangie: What’s the plan though , we gonna do this on Monday or what??
[2020/03/07, 17:33:32] Chloë: I think we have to
[2020/03/07, 17:33:33] Chloë: Since we can't connect remotely (yet)
[2020/03/07, 17:45:10] Bangie: Okay cool we’ll do it on Monday
[2020/03/08, 11:03:33] Bangie: Anyone winning with ML?
[2020/03/08, 19:46:46] Chloë: Not really tbh
[2020/03/08, 19:46:58] Chloë: Are you guys fine with meeting at 12 tomorrow?
[2020/03/08, 19:47:46] Bangie: Is there gonna be a lab ??
[2020/03/08, 19:47:52] Chloë: 🤷🏽‍♀
[2020/03/08, 19:48:05] Chloë: I will probably have to leave before it anyway
[2020/03/08, 19:48:17] Chloë: And I doubt I'll miss anything important 🙃
[2020/03/08, 19:48:21] Bangie: I doubt we’ll do anything
[2020/03/08, 19:48:26] Dino: Why wouldn’t there be?
[2020/03/08, 19:48:30] Chloë: Exactly 😂
[2020/03/08, 19:48:41] Dino: I’m down to meet at 1 and just work all the way through the lab
[2020/03/08, 19:48:56] Dino: Well we have stuff to do in the project so we could just do it during the lab together
[2020/03/08, 19:49:43] Bangie: Yeah we can do this
[2020/03/08, 19:50:08] Chloë: So we'll meet at 1?
[2020/03/08, 20:00:23] Philani: I'm down for 1
[2020/03/08, 20:14:44] Reece: I can do 1:05 non negotiable
[2020/03/08, 20:32:45] Chloë: I'm sure we can make that happen for you Reece
[2020/03/08, 21:06:33] Dino: I’m cool with 1 ✌🏼 Jesse is that good?
[2020/03/08, 21:07:01] Reece: 1:05*
[2020/03/08, 21:07:25] Dino: 1:05, sorry 😂
[2020/03/08, 21:51:39] Jesse: 👍🙂
[2020/03/08, 21:51:51] Jesse: I might be 5 mins late
[2020/03/09, 08:17:08] Bangie: Guys the different classes we have for our project are
Lecturers 
Students 
Graphs
Questions 
What else ?? Like what other tables for our database ?
[2020/03/09, 08:56:54] Chloë: I don't think we put graphs and questions in the database at all to be honest
[2020/03/09, 08:57:17] Bangie: Okay but it is an object right ?
[2020/03/09, 08:57:27] Bangie: So is it just lecturers and students ??
[2020/03/09, 08:57:53] Chloë: We don't need it to be in the database, but maybe in the final program if it needs to be
[2020/03/09, 08:58:03] Chloë: Not the questions though
[2020/03/09, 08:58:27] Chloë: You would just need the answer graph and the model graph to check their equivalency if anything
[2020/03/09, 08:58:47] Chloë: And those would be the same type of object anyway, just both graphs
[2020/03/09, 09:00:37] Bangie: Okay so In the class diagram should I just put lectures students and graphs ?
[2020/03/09, 09:01:25] Chloë: Should be fine yeah
[2020/03/09, 09:01:40] Bangie: Okay and then we can add things if necessary
[2020/03/09, 09:01:58] Chloë: Always, it's a process
[2020/03/09, 12:15:48] Chloë: I'm in the laptop room if/when anyone's ready
[2020/03/09, 13:01:17] Philani: We're up here
[2020/03/09, 13:30:05] Dino: Server details

IP Address: 146.141.21.31

Prompt to get in: student@146.141.21.31

Password: SD2020!
[2020/03/09, 16:34:20] Bangie: Guys for minimum weighted spanning tree and dijkstras algorithm to see if the two graphs are equivalent we can just check if the distance of the shortest path is the same for both graphs
[2020/03/09, 16:58:12] Chloë: Pretty sure that would work
[2020/03/09, 16:58:12] Chloë: But the minimum weighted spanning tree needs to have the same total cost
[2020/03/09, 16:58:32] Bangie: Yeah but what would we do for dfs and bfs
[2020/03/09, 17:23:27] Chloë: I guess there you actually need to check the edges
[2020/03/09, 17:24:23] Bangie: Okay but you can’t because a dfs could be different for a particular graph
[2020/03/09, 17:24:41] Bangie: I guess we’d just have to see if every node is visited at most one time
[2020/03/09, 17:26:15] Bangie: https://github.com/rylanperumal/continuous_integration_demo
[2020/03/09, 19:14:57] Bangie: For the depth first search and breadth first search are we gonna explicitly say that they must do it from a specific node ??
[2020/03/09, 19:15:08] Jesse: I think so
[2020/03/09, 19:21:17] Chloë: That should work, but we need to check how the questions are asked
[2020/03/09, 19:22:33] Dino: I think we’d have to. Or else there’d be infinite answers
[2020/03/09, 19:23:41] Bangie: I asked that tutor guy , how would we compare two dfs trees and he told me you wouldn’t be able to but you could compare each node they add to the algorithm and check every time they add a node
[2020/03/10, 17:17:30] Bangie: Guys any progress on ML
[2020/03/11, 18:26:26] Bangie: Guys a lot of the videos online on testing code is done using JavaScript
[2020/03/11, 18:31:15] Dino: Won’t that work though? Surely our code doesn’t have to be the same language as testing code
[2020/03/11, 18:31:48] Bangie: You see there’s like your file and then in JavaScript there’s a test file of your file where you run your tests
[2020/03/11, 18:34:18] Dino: So what’s the issue?
[2020/03/11, 18:36:36] Bangie: So the JavaScript file has like our code but now because we using java it won’t work because we can’t create a .test file
[2020/03/11, 18:56:48] Bangie: Android studio has a built in unit test thing but Rylan said we have to still test it using circle ci
[2020/03/11, 19:25:10] Bangie: https://github.com/Team-Brogrammers/MidYearRegistration
[2020/03/11, 19:25:28] Bangie: A team last year who did their app in android studio
[2020/03/12, 12:53:22] Bangie: When are we meeting Pravesh again ? And when are we meeting again ??
[2020/03/12, 15:07:03] Philani: I rate when we're done setting up that virtual machine.
[2020/03/12, 16:31:06] Dino: Dope ✌🏼
[2020/03/12, 16:31:06] Dino: Maybe we should meet with him before the next sprint because that will only be done by then
[2020/03/12, 16:33:24] Bangie: I’m gonna try and setup like a dummy repository with Travis ci and android studio
[2020/03/12, 16:34:31] Dino: We wouldn’t be using Android studio though so what’s the point?
[2020/03/12, 16:36:27] Bangie: What IDE are we using ?
[2020/03/12, 16:48:17] Dino: Whatever IDE we want but we’re not making an app?
[2020/03/12, 16:49:41] Bangie: Netbeans ?
[2020/03/12, 16:49:52] Dino: If you want
[2020/03/12, 16:50:46] Bangie: Let me know then I can check how to run tests on it and configure Travis ci with it
[2020/03/12, 16:51:32] Dino: We don’t have to use the same IDE dude. The whole point of the CI websites is so that it doesn’t have to be done locally and it standardized it
[2020/03/12, 16:56:33] Bangie: Yeah I get you but in the config file it literally says you have to put the language , so if you using android studio you put android
[2020/03/12, 16:56:48] Bangie: And we can only have yml file
[2020/03/12, 16:57:04] Dino: Would the language not be java?
[2020/03/12, 16:57:19] Bangie: According to the video I watched no
[2020/03/12, 16:57:59] Bangie: So then what happens if you push the android studio file into GitHub it runs all the tests for that file
[2020/03/12, 16:58:58] Bangie: Like GitHub allows us to edit each other’s code but if I use netbeans and you use like eclipse , the coding is completely different
[2020/03/12, 16:59:50] Dino: How does that make sense though?😅
[2020/03/12, 17:01:10] Bangie: Like netbeans uses jframes and like android studio doesn’t so if edit your code from netbeans on android studio it won’t work
[2020/03/12, 17:02:03] Dino: But java is java isn’t it? Sorry dude I’m not following you but yeah I don’t know whatever you think will work
[2020/03/12, 17:02:21] Bangie: Like in JavaScript and html because we making the interface using HTML but we using JavaScript to code then we can use whatever editor
[2020/03/12, 17:03:55] Bangie: Okay remember in android studio there was a thing where you say button.setonclicklistener 
Like netbeans doesn’t have that 
Netbeans has button.setactionlistener
[2020/03/12, 17:04:28] Dino: Okay that makes sense
[2020/03/12, 17:04:34] Bangie: Like if we didn’t have to have an ide then I totally agree with you
[2020/03/12, 17:04:41] Bangie: Because then it’s just java
[2020/03/12, 17:06:20] Bangie: Like for now I’ll look for how to run tests on a file then we can just include all those files because at this point we don’t have an interface
[2020/03/15, 09:31:04] Dino: We gonna meet tomorrow?
[2020/03/15, 11:32:57] Philani: I think we could. Has anyone actually finished their parts yet, though? Cause we do have next week and the break as well.
[2020/03/15, 12:11:03] Bangie: I finished majority of the diagrams , gonna finish the rest in the week
[2020/03/15, 13:26:07] Reece: Yeah I’m pretty sure we don’t have anything to meet for right now. Maybe on Friday? Then we can discuss what needs to be done during the break.
[2020/03/15, 13:30:33] Dino: Yeah I guess. But just remember we need to have proof of daily scrum meetings so people actually need to reply on the group
[2020/03/15, 13:47:10] Chloë: So I guess we meet some time later this week? How about wednesday morning, before the lecture?
[2020/03/15, 13:47:20] Chloë: Or just Friday morning, before CGV
[2020/03/15, 13:47:59] Reece: I will not be attending campus on Wednesday as I will most probably be cramming for Thursday
[2020/03/15, 13:48:11] Reece: I’m good with this
[2020/03/15, 13:48:28] Chloë: So Friday morning then? That good with everyone?
[2020/03/15, 14:01:50] Philani: I'm good with Friday.
[2020/03/15, 14:09:43] Bangie: We need to setup testing 🙈
[2020/03/15, 14:10:14] Bangie: Like I know how to test code locally but can’t seem to get it to work with continous integration thing
[2020/03/15, 17:41:50] Dino: Friday is good ✌🏼
[2020/03/15, 17:42:00] Dino: Is anybody gonna go in tomorrow?
[2020/03/15, 17:50:53] Bangie: I’m going in
[2020/03/15, 17:57:37] Philani: I'm going just for the lab.
[2020/03/15, 18:31:13] Chloë: Did you guys do anything interesting last week? Like do you rate I need to come if we're not meeting
[2020/03/15, 19:27:27] Philani: Not really
[2020/03/15, 19:29:18] Dino: ‎This message was deleted.
[2020/03/15, 19:29:30] Dino: That’s what I’m thinking, because last week was useless 😂
[2020/03/15, 19:29:43] Dino: Fuck these WhatsApp stickers are annoying
[2020/03/15, 19:29:51] Chloë: Lmao so we wouldn't be missing anything you say 🤣
[2020/03/15, 19:30:17] Chloë: Also, coronavirus has hit Wits so liiiiike 😷
[2020/03/15, 19:34:29] Reece: Med Campus
[2020/03/15, 19:35:00] Chloë: I'm aware
[2020/03/15, 19:35:52] Dino: I back wits is gonna close before the end of the week 😂
[2020/03/15, 19:37:47] Reece: If I spend the next few days studying ML just for Wits to close before we can write imma be livid
[2020/03/15, 19:38:02] Dino: I feel that dude 😂
‎[2020/03/15, 20:14:38] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/15, 20:15:00] Chloë: Guys schools are closing
[2020/03/15, 20:15:08] Chloë: What about Wits?

[2020/03/15, 20:16:10] Reece: _”increasing vigilance”_
[2020/03/15, 20:17:18] Reece: To be fair though I don’t think the government decides whether or not universities close
[2020/03/15, 20:17:25] Reece: Wits has to make that decision
[2020/03/15, 20:18:32] Dino: Yeah that’s what I think too
[2020/03/15, 20:26:25] Chloë: Habib says no classes tomorrow
[2020/03/15, 20:26:49] Dino: Habib?
[2020/03/15, 20:27:10] Chloë: Adam Habib on eNCA my man
[2020/03/15, 20:27:17] Chloë: Vice chancellor
[2020/03/15, 20:27:21] Dino: Hectic 😂😂😂
[2020/03/15, 20:27:32] Dino: No I know who Habib is but didn’t know where you got that
[2020/03/15, 20:28:09] Chloë: Nah I'm watching 🤣 we're invested here
‎[2020/03/15, 20:45:49] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/15, 20:46:25] Chloë: Awesome. Thanks Dino
[2020/03/15, 20:46:51] Chloë: So it seems that our daily scrums will all have to be via whatsapp/skype calls ey
[2020/03/15, 20:47:10] Chloë: At least we're doing coms, almost no need for us to come in anyway
[2020/03/16, 08:47:15] Bangie: Hey guys so I think I got this Travis ci with a normal java project to work
[2020/03/16, 08:50:25] Chloë: Ahhhh awesome
[2020/03/16, 08:50:49] Chloë: Unrelated, but I found some cool as hell animations
[2020/03/16, 08:51:03] Chloë: https://cloudinary.com/blog/creating_html5_animations
[2020/03/16, 09:33:11] Dino: Nice man 😏
[2020/03/16, 09:33:23] Dino: Sick thanks Chloe ✌🏼
[2020/03/16, 09:34:46] Bangie: I’ll show you guys when we meet again
[2020/03/16, 09:38:29] Philani: Awe Goolam 💪🏾
‎[2020/03/16, 10:36:31] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/16, 10:37:17] Chloë: The second parameter is the y axis, I _think_ negative values move you up
[2020/03/16, 10:37:21] Chloë: But just experiment
[2020/03/16, 10:38:26] Reece: Set the x value to zero and the y value to some constant times frame number
[2020/03/16, 10:39:57] Philani: That worked. Thanks so much 🙏🏾
[2020/03/16, 10:40:37] Dino: I found it easier to resize the canvas at the top. I set the 
Leftx=-50
Rightx=50
Bottomy=-50
Topy =50

It helped me because it just made more sense so maybe just mess around with that
[2020/03/16, 10:41:57] Reece: Isn’t the canvas ratio 3:4 though?
[2020/03/16, 10:43:13] Reece: So wouldn’t something that scales each dimensional equally be better
[2020/03/16, 10:44:11] Dino: Nah that’s what they’ve set it to be. 
If you go look at the top you’ll see they’ve set the x to be from 0 to 8 and the y from 0 to 6 or something like that
[2020/03/16, 10:44:21] Dino: And I wanted a square canvas so I just changed the parameters
[2020/03/16, 10:45:08] Reece: Oh awe
[2020/03/16, 10:46:20] Reece: If anyone’s finished send your scenes. I need some inspiration as I suffer from a severe lack of creativity 😂🙃
‎[2020/03/16, 10:46:31] Dino: ‎video omitted
[2020/03/16, 10:47:09] Reece: Make the increment smaller
[2020/03/16, 10:48:12] Reece: Holy shit this is sick but also I now have epilepsy
[2020/03/16, 10:48:15] Dino: So instead of framenumber++, something like framenumber + 0,1
[2020/03/16, 10:48:26] Dino: 😂😂😂 sorry should’ve given a warning
[2020/03/16, 10:48:28] Reece: Probably even smaller
[2020/03/16, 10:48:41] Reece: Wait no
[2020/03/16, 10:48:46] Dino: Awe I’ll try it out ✌🏼
[2020/03/16, 10:49:01] Reece: Not that increment
[2020/03/16, 10:49:55] Reece: Show me the line that changes the color
[2020/03/16, 10:50:20] Reece: Because doing this is gonna fuck up everything else
[2020/03/16, 10:51:15] Dino: I’ll show you now now
[2020/03/16, 10:57:12] Bangie: Who’s done ML??
[2020/03/16, 10:59:47] Dino: I’ve done the first part, up until splitting the data
‎[2020/03/16, 11:48:33] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/16, 11:51:32] Reece: And the code in the frame update?
[2020/03/16, 11:51:56] Dino: I just have frameNumber++
[2020/03/16, 11:52:06] Reece: Oh shit I see
[2020/03/16, 11:52:25] Reece: You’re fucked because the colors have nothing to do with the frames
[2020/03/16, 11:52:59] Dino: Exactly 🙄 like the rotation depends on the frame number so that can be controlled
[2020/03/16, 11:53:03] Reece: It just changes randomly every time a circle is drawn (I.e. at every frame)
[2020/03/16, 11:53:58] Reece: Maybe change the color within the frame update instead of within the draw function?
[2020/03/16, 11:54:59] Reece: And then set it to only change every few frames instead of every single one
[2020/03/16, 11:56:54] Reece: So like if you wanted it to update every 4 frames instead of every frame you just say  if framenumber mod 4 = 0 then update the colours
[2020/03/16, 12:09:42] Dino: Eish I’m struggling, thanks though man. But it’s fine I’ll rather focus on ML for now and get back to it if I can, at least I have something
[2020/03/17, 09:32:18] Bangie: Guys since there’s no campus , how do you guys want to like meet up with each other and Pravesh
[2020/03/17, 10:35:21] Dino: I guess we could set up Skype calls 😂
[2020/03/17, 10:36:52] Bangie: Awe 😂
[2020/03/17, 10:37:06] Bangie: How far is everyone with ML
[2020/03/17, 11:24:26] Philani: Is it still for today?
[2020/03/17, 11:24:39] Philani: Cause he extended all the others.
[2020/03/17, 11:25:00] Dino: It currently is but I feel like he might extend it
[2020/03/17, 11:26:46] Philani: Okay cool.
‎[2020/03/17, 11:44:34] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/17, 11:46:44] Dino: Doooope ✌🏼
[2020/03/17, 17:05:00] Bangie: Guys has everyone done most of their parts for this sprint ??
[2020/03/17, 17:06:08] Dino: I haven’t been able to do anything because of the server
[2020/03/17, 17:06:32] Bangie: No that’s fine because shun has to sort that out isn’t
[2020/03/17, 17:07:11] Bangie: I’ve done the testing shit and everything and set it up with eclipse but I did it on my own repo In case I fucked it up
[2020/03/17, 17:07:15] Bangie: And I drew the diagrams
[2020/03/17, 17:11:08] Philani: I still need to do mine. I'll have it done before the sprint.
[2020/03/17, 17:43:24] Chloë: We're *in* the sprint
[2020/03/17, 17:44:25] Chloë: And I can only test once we have that up anyway, but I'm still working on setting things up. Push comes to shove, I've installed some stuff to set up a server on my own laptop so we can see _something_ at least
[2020/03/17, 17:45:25] Bangie: Okay so everyone who’s writing the functions for the various graphs like dijkstra 
Can you maybe just write a test function ?
[2020/03/17, 17:45:47] Bangie: Eclipse has a very good setup for unit tests
[2020/03/17, 17:48:59] Philani: sprint retrospective *
[2020/03/17, 17:49:25] Philani: Yeah I can try. Can you please send the link to that youtube video
[2020/03/17, 17:49:29] Bangie: I’ll send something on the group that shows how to write tests
[2020/03/17, 17:49:52] Philani: Thanks 👍🏾
[2020/03/17, 17:51:17] Bangie: The repo does the Travis CI testing shit so that’s fine I’ll connect it to coveralls this weekend
[2020/03/17, 17:51:30] Bangie: What else is there for this sprint ?
[2020/03/17, 17:52:46] Philani: Not too sure. Did Rylan mention anything about meeting with the client again?
[2020/03/17, 17:52:59] Bangie: That just depends on us
[2020/03/17, 17:55:32] Chloë: Check Taiga for the user stories in this sprint, that should be everything. There's a taskboard too
[2020/03/17, 17:55:47] Chloë: So once you're done with something you can move it along
[2020/03/17, 17:56:24] Chloë: Seems hard to do right now tbh 🤣 I feel like they might be fine with email correspondence for this sprint
[2020/03/17, 17:57:03] Philani: True 😂
[2020/03/17, 17:57:07] Dino: Definitely 😂
[2020/03/17, 17:57:22] Dino: What can I do? Seeing as I can’t do much with the server
[2020/03/17, 17:58:05] Chloë: Maybe just help the other guys out with testing and getting circleCI doing the things
[2020/03/17, 17:58:34] Chloë: It feels like all the hard work is going into management and not actual development 🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀
[2020/03/17, 18:00:14] Bangie: I sorted this out but with Travis CI
[2020/03/17, 18:00:44] Chloë: Oh awesome! Do we know what we need to do for coveralls? /what even those are
[2020/03/17, 18:01:40] Dino: Bangie should I maybe help you link up our repository with TravisCI because it’ll probably have to be on my account?
[2020/03/17, 18:02:07] Bangie: I’ll sort that out but can we use a different coverage thingy ??
[2020/03/17, 18:02:36] Bangie: I wish we could physically meet so I could show you how I did it 🙈
[2020/03/17, 18:03:40] Dino: We could always do a video chat 😂
[2020/03/17, 18:04:01] Bangie: Awe tell me when then I’ll show you 😂
[2020/03/17, 18:10:30] Chloë: 🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀
[2020/03/17, 18:14:07] Reece: When should we have everything for this sprint done by? Campus only reopens mid April so like I can already see meetings and deciding on stuff like this becoming a mission.
[2020/03/17, 18:14:59] Chloë: Well the sprint retrospective is on the 30th so probably by then?
[2020/03/17, 18:15:16] Chloë: Just everything we *can* get done
[2020/03/18, 12:53:18] Bangie: https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit/article.html#eclipse-support-for-junit-4
[2020/03/19, 17:30:01] Bangie: Guys should every thing for this sprint be done by the 30th March ?
[2020/03/19, 17:40:00] Bangie: Let’s have it done so we can have our next meeting with a Skype call or something and discuss what we doing next ??
[2020/03/19, 17:55:43] Philani: Yeah
[2020/03/19, 17:55:54] Philani: Awe ✌🏾
[2020/03/19, 17:57:16] Bangie: Because we need to start looking at interface and database shit right ??
[2020/03/19, 18:28:46] Philani: Aren't we gonna use Moodle for all the database stuff?
[2020/03/19, 18:29:40] Bangie: I thought we just using that for logging in ?
[2020/03/19, 18:36:47] Philani: Yeah, so when you log in it's gonna check your username and password that you put in with the ones in the moodle database, right?
[2020/03/19, 18:45:38] Bangie: Yeah but like a database to store questions and shit ??
[2020/03/19, 18:46:03] Chloë: Again, you would literally never store questions in a database
[2020/03/19, 18:57:44] Bangie: Where would we store them ??
[2020/03/19, 18:57:52] Bangie: Okay we’ll discuss this when we meet again
[2020/03/19, 18:58:07] Chloë: You wouldn't... we're only coding a marker
[2020/03/19, 18:58:30] Dino: I think we really need to discuss this stuff again. I don’t think we’re all too clear on what we’re trying to achieve, I know I’m not 😂
[2020/03/19, 18:59:13] Bangie: Yeah we legit need to 😂
[2020/03/20, 13:08:10] Bangie: Guys I got the ci environment to work but I can’t get coveralls to work
[2020/03/20, 14:56:08] Bangie: Dino do you want to maybe help with setting up circle ci/Travis ci and coveralls
[2020/03/20, 14:56:27] Bangie: Because I realized my one worked no matter what code you tested 🙈
[2020/03/20, 15:19:08] Bangie: Do we have to use java because this thing is fucking over with java 🙈
[2020/03/20, 15:36:50] Philani: Awe, thanks man ✌🏾
[2020/03/20, 15:37:12] Philani: What other language would it work it that we also know very well? 😅
[2020/03/20, 17:15:40] Bangie: We gonna have an online meeting on Monday ?
[2020/03/20, 18:02:30] Philani: I'm down if we need to.
[2020/03/20, 18:12:21] Bangie: Let’s have one
[2020/03/21, 05:35:10] Chloë: Will try, but I might have shitey wifi at that time
[2020/03/21, 10:26:03] Dino: Yeah sure bro ✌🏼
[2020/03/21, 10:26:08] Dino: I’m down
[2020/03/21, 10:26:40] Bangie: I might have made some process , so I’ll check again today
[2020/03/21, 15:44:36] Bangie: Guys got Travis and code cov to work apparently
[2020/03/21, 16:12:49] Philani: Awe, that's really good news.
[2020/03/21, 16:13:26] Bangie: But like the code I’m testing is just a simple calculator thing 😂
[2020/03/21, 20:41:00] Dino: Nice man 😏
[2020/03/22, 11:43:29] Chloë: So guys, for a Moodle plugin we have to choose a type for it
[2020/03/22, 11:44:03] Chloë: They have 24 types to choose from and I'm stuck between 2 that describe ours decently
[2020/03/22, 11:44:36] Chloë: Assignment submission plugins - different forms of assignment submissions
[2020/03/22, 11:44:39] Chloë: or
[2020/03/22, 11:45:19] Chloë: Advanced grading methods - Interfaces for actually performing grading in activity modules (e.g. rubrics)
[2020/03/22, 11:46:07] Chloë: Those are the descriptions given on the website, all a little vague
[2020/03/22, 11:46:23] Dino: Eish that’s close. I back assignment submission plugins
[2020/03/22, 11:46:27] Reece: _Interface_ is making me lean towards this one
[2020/03/22, 11:46:41] Bangie: Same 😂 I saw interface
[2020/03/22, 11:47:15] Reece: But it doesn’t say interface for answering it says interface for _grading_ so idk
[2020/03/22, 11:47:33] Chloë: I know.... it's a weird one
[2020/03/22, 11:53:03] Bangie: Because of it being vague we should choose the first one I think
[2020/03/22, 11:54:48] Philani: This one sounds like it to me 😂😅
[2020/03/22, 11:55:13] Dino: This is so confusing 😂
[2020/03/22, 11:55:29] Reece: Maybe we could ask Pravesh?
[2020/03/22, 11:55:43] Dino: That’s a good idea, these are the kinda questions he could help with
[2020/03/22, 12:16:12] Chloë: Okay, for now I'll pick the second one since that seems to be the most popular, and we can change it after we ask Pravesh
[2020/03/22, 12:16:35] Chloë: Is the name of our plugin officially going to be "Graph Marker"?
[2020/03/22, 12:44:55] Philani: I think that's fine.
[2020/03/22, 14:53:24] Dino: Sweet ✌🏼
[2020/03/22, 14:53:28] Dino: Agreed
[2020/03/23, 16:22:17] Bangie: Guys are we gonna have a meeting ?
[2020/03/23, 16:22:24] Bangie: Like we can just have it on WhatsApp ?
[2020/03/23, 16:23:49] Philani: I'm chilled to have one.
[2020/03/23, 16:24:20] Chloë: I think that's our best/only option
[2020/03/23, 16:24:54] Chloë: On my side, I'm making progress with the Moodle plugin but it's slow going, there's a mountain of documentation and all of it just leads to more things to read
[2020/03/23, 16:25:22] Chloë: Also, I'm setting up a server on my laptop for now, til we can either get back to Wits or connect remotely
[2020/03/23, 16:25:31] Dino: I still don’t have access to the server. I’ll try email Shun again
[2020/03/23, 16:25:51] Chloë: If anyone is done with their part for this sprint, I'll send the mountain of links for the Moodle stuff and we can all work on that
[2020/03/23, 16:26:07] Chloë: For now, I've got a few of the essential files posted on github under GraphMarker
[2020/03/23, 16:26:07] Dino: Please 🙏🏼
[2020/03/23, 16:26:48] Chloë: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugin_files
[2020/03/23, 16:27:03] Chloë: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_architecture
[2020/03/23, 16:27:12] Chloë: https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Installing_Moodle
[2020/03/23, 16:27:33] Chloë: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Tutorial#What_type_of_plugin_are_you_developing.3F
[2020/03/23, 16:27:55] Chloë: Those are the big/most relevant ones, everything else leads from those pages I think
[2020/03/23, 16:28:34] Chloë: https://www.w3schools.com/php/
[2020/03/23, 16:28:45] Chloë: This will likely be necessary
[2020/03/23, 16:29:20] Philani: On my side I haven't yet started. Once I'm done with ML I'll get a move on it, either later today or definitely tomorrow.
[2020/03/23, 16:29:46] Chloë: And a tip for anyone who wants to write some PHP files for this thing, Moodle can apparently screw up if you use the closing tags for the file, so just use <?php at the beginning, no closing tags at the end of the file
[2020/03/23, 16:30:55] Chloë: Definitely after 2pm tomorrow 😂
[2020/03/23, 16:31:36] Chloë: And everyone else? @27832807296 @27795810646
[2020/03/23, 16:31:44] Philani: Yeah😅
[2020/03/23, 16:32:48] Dino: Cool thanks Chloe ✌🏼
[2020/03/23, 16:34:10] Bangie: So I’ve setup a dummy repo with Travis ci and code coverage , so it’s currently working , so like how it works is with maven , so remember with android studio we had that gradle thing , at the moment The project uses maven . But that’s not important , the only thing we might have to do is change the java files once everyone has written their java codes and tests
[2020/03/23, 16:34:12] Reece: What’s the question
[2020/03/23, 16:34:41] Chloë: No problem. There's a style guide that has all of these things, it'll probably come up in your research but that seemed to be a big one. I rate if we follow it well we'll have fewer issues trying to edit each other's code and using pre-existing code
[2020/03/23, 16:35:00] Chloë: Progress or anything you'd like to share
[2020/03/23, 16:35:21] Bangie: I’ve also drawn some of the diagrams , Chloe can you explain our project so I know how to draw up the rest , like what’s the actual process of the lecturer and student
[2020/03/23, 16:36:19] Chloë: Could you send the link to your other repo where you posted the diagrams? Then we can all take a look and discuss it
‎[2020/03/23, 16:36:29] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/23, 16:36:52] Chloë: Nice
[2020/03/23, 16:36:56] Bangie: I haven’t posted the diagrams online as yet I just drew them by hand
[2020/03/23, 16:37:28] Chloë: Okay that's perfect though, just a picture on the group should be fine
‎[2020/03/23, 16:37:41] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/23, 16:37:56] Chloë: We can add them to the main repo then, I'll put it under an "admin" folder
‎[2020/03/23, 16:37:58] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/23, 16:39:32] Chloë: Looks good
[2020/03/23, 16:39:42] Philani: Nice work, Goolam 👍🏾
[2020/03/23, 16:39:47] Chloë: Did you find tutorials on how to write the test code?
[2020/03/23, 16:39:52] Bangie: I drew 3 out of the 6 apparently we should have , the one is a class diagram , the other is an activity diagram and the other is a state machine diagram . Will send the pictures now now
[2020/03/23, 16:40:27] Philani: I'll let you guys know how I go with my part. I'm mainly just gonna google the code for the algorithms and just adjust it for our project ✌🏾
[2020/03/23, 16:40:54] Bangie: Yeah it’s pretty simple , I sent philani the link on how to do it
[2020/03/23, 16:42:19] Chloë: Ok sweet
[2020/03/23, 16:42:25] Bangie: The only thing is that you’d have to have a maven project on eclipse , so you can run the tests
[2020/03/23, 16:42:41] Philani: https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit/article.html#eclipse-support-for-junit-4
[2020/03/23, 16:42:51] Bangie: But what everyone can do is just take the java files from the repo and edit them
[2020/03/23, 16:43:02] Chloë: I suppose we should all try and use Eclipse then, for everything Java-related
[2020/03/23, 16:43:15] Philani: Yeah
[2020/03/23, 16:43:15] Chloë: Thanks dude
[2020/03/23, 16:43:24] Bangie: But eclipse doesn’t have an interface thing which is an issue
[2020/03/23, 16:44:05] Bangie: Netbeans has an interface thing and also uses maven so we could try that
[2020/03/23, 16:44:12] Chloë: The drag-and-drop GUI builder?
[2020/03/23, 16:44:30] Bangie: If we can use android studio then there’s a setup of Travis ci and coveralls with android studio
[2020/03/23, 16:44:34] Chloë: I don't especially think we'll need that
[2020/03/23, 16:44:58] Chloë: We're not building an Android app though
[2020/03/23, 16:45:16] Bangie: Not sure how we can do this tbh ❤️
[2020/03/23, 16:45:20] Bangie: 🙈*
[2020/03/23, 16:45:46] Chloë: The built-in GUI builder will most likely be totally useless for what we need
[2020/03/23, 16:46:07] Chloë: It'll probably end up being a combo of javascript, java, and php
[2020/03/23, 16:46:42] Chloë: The Moodle docs have some articles related to adding javascript to your plugin
[2020/03/23, 16:47:42] Chloë: So let's not get hung up on that for choosing an IDE. If Eclipse has the best features for things we need, let's go with that
[2020/03/23, 16:48:14] Bangie: I get you but what about interface ?
[2020/03/23, 16:49:44] Chloë: You can write an interface in any IDE, and the built-in GUI builder in netbeans doesn't actually have much of anything that'll be useful for our purposes
[2020/03/23, 16:50:16] Bangie: So like we can write an ide in html but have our code in java ?
[2020/03/23, 16:50:20] Chloë: Also, our interface is going to be used in a browser, all signs point to javascript
[2020/03/23, 16:50:39] Bangie: Yeah for sure
[2020/03/23, 16:50:45] Chloë: The IDE is the program you use to write your code, the interface is what we're creating
[2020/03/23, 16:50:51] Philani: So we're still gonna use Eclipse?
[2020/03/23, 16:51:42] Chloë: There are ways to write parts of the plugin in some languages and others in different ones, the Moodle docs specifically have stuff for adding Javascript
[2020/03/23, 16:52:19] Bangie: I get you but like is there a way to link a JavaScript interface to java code ?
[2020/03/23, 16:52:44] Chloë: Google it, but my instincts say yes

[2020/03/23, 16:53:31] Chloë: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7487908/how-can-i-use-javascript-in-java
[2020/03/23, 16:54:57] Chloë: That's just for adding it to Java, but for the plugin specifically, it looks like Moodle lets you add javascript files to your project and they have their own method for that
[2020/03/23, 16:55:32] Bangie: Is our thing a web app ??
[2020/03/23, 16:55:50] Bangie: Can you explain our system so I can draw the rest of the graphs tomorrow as I’m currently confused out of my mind
[2020/03/23, 17:00:54] Bangie: What we could do is just use JavaScript and not java but then the only thing is that everything for Travis ci and coveralls will have to change 😂
[2020/03/23, 17:05:56] Dino: Bangie should I maybe copy the diagrams digitally?
[2020/03/23, 17:09:47] Bangie: You can do that bro , I need to still do 3 more
[2020/03/23, 17:10:11] Bangie: Guys so on eclipse there’s a way to create a web app which will be like connecting it will html
[2020/03/23, 18:01:00] Chloë: Nah, don't waste time on that
[2020/03/23, 18:01:34] Chloë: Scan them in if you can but rather work on the actual project, they don't care if drawings like that are pretty, they just need to be there
[2020/03/23, 18:02:03] Bangie: I don’t see anything online where we can make our interface with JavaScript but write our code in java
[2020/03/23, 18:05:50] Bangie: What do you guys want to do ?
[2020/03/23, 18:06:33] Chloë: When I start working on it again I'll send you the Moodle docs on it, but for now I'd say let's focus on the logical part of our program
[2020/03/23, 18:06:47] Chloë: And getting a working empty plugin uploaded
[2020/03/23, 21:29:30] Bangie: Guys I created a repo for JavaScript as well if we decide to do our shit in JS
[2020/03/24, 16:46:15] Bangie: Guys if you want you can code your things in Javasctipt as well because I have created a repo that works
[2020/03/24, 16:46:40] Bangie: Writing tests also aren’t bad with js also
[2020/03/24, 17:08:16] Dino: Fair enough ✌🏼
[2020/03/25, 10:22:24] Bangie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB7vnoXI0pE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3QwafQEvSs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OjEx2UzLUI&t=1077s watch these 3 for understanding
[2020/03/25, 10:22:39] Bangie: Watch the second video for writing tests in js
[2020/03/25, 10:52:32] Philani: Awe thanks ✌🏾
[2020/03/25, 10:52:45] Philani: So we're definitely doing our parts in javascriptm
[2020/03/25, 10:52:46] Philani: ?*
[2020/03/25, 11:49:55] Dino: Sweet thanks man ✌🏼
[2020/03/25, 11:58:31] Bangie: For now it doesn’t matter , it’s gonna matter when we decide interface and shit
[2020/03/25, 11:59:02] Dino: Are we gonna use CircleCI or TravisCI?
[2020/03/25, 11:59:27] Bangie: Soo I setup JavaScript using circle
[2020/03/25, 11:59:31] Bangie: And java using Travis
[2020/03/25, 15:04:52] Philani: Okay cool
[2020/03/25, 15:09:03] Bangie: But I think the interface is gonna be easier with js
[2020/03/25, 17:24:33] Dino: I did the tutorial you sent so I managed to set up JavaScript testing with CircleCI
[2020/03/25, 17:24:49] Dino: It seems like coveralls works better with TravisCI than with CircleCI?
[2020/03/25, 17:27:09] Bangie: Let me send you the shit to connect coveralls with circle
[2020/03/25, 17:29:29] Dino: Please 🙏🏼
[2020/03/25, 17:29:39] Bangie: Two mins
[2020/03/25, 17:29:48] Dino: Awe no rush
[2020/03/25, 17:46:59] Bangie: Bro I genuinely think coveralls is broken 😂
[2020/03/25, 17:47:32] Bangie: I added shit to my master branch and it builds on circle ci but doesn’t build on coveralls
[2020/03/25, 17:51:15] Dino: Eish I couldn’t even connect coveralls 😂
[2020/03/25, 17:52:01] Bangie: It’s connected to mine so maybe just try this
[2020/03/25, 17:57:02] Bangie: Awe try this so do you have that folder called node_modules ??
[2020/03/25, 17:57:24] Dino: Yeah ✌🏼
[2020/03/25, 17:59:03] Bangie: Okay so push that to the repo as well on the main page
‎[2020/03/25, 18:00:32] Bangie: ‎image omitted
‎[2020/03/25, 18:01:39] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/25, 18:06:06] Bangie: Also in that folder you created all your files
‎[2020/03/25, 18:06:38] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/03/25, 18:08:59] Bangie: If you don’t understand phone me and I’ll walk you through it step by step
[2020/03/25, 18:16:02] Dino: Thanks dude I’ll try tomorrow 🙏🏼
[2020/03/25, 18:16:12] Bangie: Awe phone me if you can’t get it
[2020/03/26, 13:48:19] Dino: Jesse everything good your side?
[2020/03/27, 14:19:45] Bangie: Guys any updates ?
[2020/03/27, 14:30:28] Philani: Still working on MWST in javascript 🙈 but I think I'm close to finishing.
[2020/03/27, 15:29:22] Reece: @27835072064 and @27795810646 what format are you storing your graphs in
[2020/03/27, 16:18:43] Philani: I don't understand what you mean by format.
[2020/03/27, 16:18:59] Bangie: Adjacency matrix or list
[2020/03/27, 16:23:02] Philani: List
[2020/03/27, 16:23:21] Philani: But I'm having issues with my code, so I minny just change. I'll let you know if I do.
[2020/03/27, 16:23:54] Chloë: Still working on the plugin files, it's a hell of a lot of work
[2020/03/27, 16:24:17] Chloë: Gonna ask Jared if he's had any real progress, since they're doing a plugin too
[2020/03/27, 20:38:55] Dino: Is there anything I can help you with Chlo?
[2020/03/27, 20:42:47] Chloë: I spoke to Jared earlier today, he said it sounds like we should be doing a question type plugin (they're doing the BCO gates plugin) and he sent me some links to a template and stuff that should be a lot easier to get running
[2020/03/27, 20:42:58] Chloë: I've sent that to Bangie already, will send on the group
[2020/03/27, 20:43:32] Chloë: https://github.com/jamiepratt/moodle-qtype_TEMPLATE
[2020/03/27, 20:43:33] Chloë: Well.

There's a template that's mentioned in the moodle doc.

It's on GitHub
[2020/03/27, 20:43:33] Chloë: You just drag it into the question type folder
[2020/03/27, 20:43:34] Chloë: That's pretty simple
[2020/03/27, 20:43:34] Chloë: You can setup a standalone version of moodle on your conputer
[2020/03/27, 20:43:34] Chloë: Yeah.

Just rename the stuff as it says.

Copy the whole folder into moodle/question/type
[2020/03/27, 20:43:35] Chloë: Also.

https://download.moodle.org/windows/

I chose 3.7.5+
[2020/03/27, 20:43:35] Chloë: And since it's a plugin.

I should be able to drag and drop it into wits moodle
[2020/03/27, 20:43:36] Chloë: Then that sounds a a qtype to me.

You allow the lecturer to create the question.

And then students can drag and drop stuff.

Moodle has a way to mark that also
[2020/03/27, 20:43:36] Chloë: Then go to moodle.

Notification and say add
[2020/03/27, 20:43:36] Chloë: I also installed moodle on my laptop
[2020/03/27, 20:43:37] Chloë: Go to site settings and notifications.

There should be an option to add the plugin
[2020/03/27, 20:43:55] Chloë: That's everything Jared said about it, he's got his up and running on his local version of Moodle
[2020/03/28, 12:30:47] Dino: Cool 👍🏻
[2020/03/28, 12:31:04] Dino: Should we also do this stuff? Or just you?
[2020/03/28, 12:34:26] Chloë: Bangie's helping me out with it at the moment, but if you want to take a look at it go ahead
[2020/03/28, 12:35:52] Dino: Is there any point though? Because you’re basically gonna do this on your own server and then transfer it to the wits server when we can right?
[2020/03/28, 18:06:30] Chloë: True true
[2020/03/28, 18:07:00] Chloë: But the files themselves need to be written, and those can be posted to github and integrated into the final product
‎[2020/03/29, 18:29:47] Dino: ‎video omitted
[2020/03/29, 18:37:31] Reece: I think it’s great
[2020/03/29, 18:38:40] Reece: But how are we gonna let the user connect nodes
[2020/03/29, 18:39:08] Reece: We’ll definitely have to store each node once it’s created
[2020/03/29, 18:39:19] Bangie: We can draw the actual lines , but the fuck up is like seeing if the line joins two nodes
[2020/03/29, 18:39:43] Reece: Then maybe we have a drop down that lets us select two nodes and connect them
[2020/03/29, 18:39:51] Reece: This would be a mission
[2020/03/29, 18:43:47] Dino: I’ve got it in the bag don’t stress, will probably take some time to implement though
[2020/03/29, 18:44:14] Dino: Something similar to this though
[2020/03/29, 18:51:28] Bangie: Yeah that’s a plan , and at the end we can have a nested for loop that loops through all the nodes and checks if they connected and if they are add them to the adjacency list
[2020/03/29, 18:55:23] Dino: I’m thinking of doing that every time they add a node, so it all gets done it real time. Then afterwards we can check if it’s all there
[2020/03/29, 18:56:21] Bangie: Okay so as they add an edge , you add that edge to the graph and to the respective adjacency lists ?
[2020/03/29, 19:53:19] Dino: Yes 🙏🏼 that’s what I’m hoping but I’ll have to see

[2020/03/29, 20:35:57] Bangie: Can always add or remove shit , but main thing is that we have them
[2020/03/30, 17:01:02] Bangie: ‎You deleted this message.
[2020/03/30, 17:50:59] Reece: Guys
[2020/03/30, 17:51:04] Reece: Is Jesse Ok
[2020/03/30, 17:51:14] Reece: Haven’t heard from the dude in ages
[2020/03/30, 18:16:16] Bangie: He’s back 😂
[2020/03/30, 18:17:08] Reece: What
[2020/03/30, 20:46:33] ‎Dino changed the subject to “Software Design Project 🖥”
[2020/03/30, 20:47:21] ‎Reece changed the subject to “SD Project  🖥”
[2020/03/30, 20:56:36] Chloë: Receiving messages again at least
[2020/03/30, 21:18:22] Reece: No good if he doesn’t read them 🤣
[2020/03/30, 21:19:04] Dino: The thing is he sent a link on the COMS group the other day 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2020/03/30, 21:28:26] Jesse: Hey guys
[2020/03/30, 21:29:13] Reece: O
[2020/03/30, 21:29:14] Reece: M
[2020/03/30, 21:29:15] Reece: G
[2020/03/30, 21:40:04] Dino: Wow
[2020/03/31, 23:30:11] Chloë: Y'all.... setting up this Moodle server is so annoying 🤣🤣🤣 I've gotten so near yet so far, and it looks like I'm gonna have to uninstall MySQL and install an older version, cause Moodle wants me to change some things that have literally been deprecated and then removed in the new version
[2020/03/31, 23:30:52] Bangie: I have MySQL and phpMyAdmin on my pc for now if we need
[2020/03/31, 23:31:02] Chloë: Which version?
[2020/03/31, 23:31:13] Chloë: Cause Moodle itself doesn't like 8.0
[2020/03/31, 23:32:50] Bangie: I’m not too sure , I downloaded it 2 days ago using the terminal
[2020/03/31, 23:33:29] Chloë: Okay, well I'm just gonna try again here but if anyone gets Moodle up and running on their machine, we'll just install the plugin there to test until we can get back to Wits
[2020/04/01, 16:13:33] Dino: Ah shit that’s so frustrating 😂
[2020/04/01, 16:14:23] Bangie: We need to get into contact with Pravesh to discuss what we can do if this quarantine is extended and we can’t get the server from wits
‎[2020/04/01, 16:14:39] Dino: ‎video omitted
[2020/04/01, 16:15:16] Dino: Next I’m gonna implement something so that they can move the nodes freely
[2020/04/01, 16:23:33] Chloë: Decent 😌
[2020/04/07, 15:47:49] Philani: Hey guys, so I was able to set up the code to find the mwst and tested it. It passes all the tests locally, but I can't really figure out how to get it to pass on CircleCi. I think it's got to do with all the files that are already on the repository. Once we get an update on what's to happen with the project then I think we can figure it out 😂✌🏾
[2020/04/07, 15:48:18] Philani: I also made a dummy repository and connected that to CircleCi and it passes.
[2020/04/07, 15:48:35] Philani: I've pushed it into Github.
[2020/04/07, 15:48:48] Bangie: I think three of us have done this 😂
[2020/04/07, 16:34:56] Philani: Okay, Goolam and I got it to work. If you go on Github, the sticker should now say passing. And if you click on it, it should take you to our page on CircleCi ✌🏾
[2020/04/07, 16:42:01] Bangie: I’m almost done with the design of our thing as well
[2020/04/08, 16:20:50] Dino: Nice guys 🙏🏼😏
[2020/04/16, 22:40:17] Dino: What’s up guys. I know this is pretty open ended but I need help with something so please let me know if you can help me out. I’m trying to do object oriented programming for the Graph Drawer thing, so basically there’s a main class with a bunch of functions and shit, and then I have a Node class, and an Edge class. I want to be able to create a Node and Edge object from the main class. In java I can do it because it’s super straight forward but I can’t seem to figure out how to do it in JavaScript, like how do I access the other classes from the main file? 
Thanks in advance 🙏🏼
[2020/04/16, 22:43:00] Chloë: I believe you have to import the file with the file name, at the top of the main file
[2020/04/16, 22:43:26] Chloë: I was watching a game dev video where the guy did exactly that, I'll send it to you
[2020/04/16, 22:43:34] Chloë: Might help for CGV as well
[2020/04/16, 22:44:00] Chloë: https://youtu.be/3EMxBkqC4z0
[2020/04/16, 22:44:37] Dino: Thanks so much Chloe, I’ll check it out 🙏🏼 none of the researches I’ve found have explained it too clearly 🙄
[2020/04/16, 22:45:28] Chloë: No problem ☺️
[2020/04/16, 22:46:23] Philani: So you have to export the node and edge classes and import them in the main class. So you'd say:

module.exports = class Node{
 Class stuff
}

And then you need to import in the main class would be 

const Node = require(./Node.js)
[2020/04/16, 22:47:06] Philani: Or you might not even have to say the ".js" in Node.js
[2020/04/16, 22:47:59] Philani: const Node = require("./Node")

This is the correct way.
[2020/04/16, 22:48:21] Bangie: If you have a class called Node in a file (node.js) at the bottom just say exports.Node=Node 
Then in your file you want to use it in say const {Node}=(‘./node’)
[2020/04/16, 23:26:17] Dino: Great thanks guys I’ll let you know if I need anything else 🙏🏼😏

[2020/04/17, 21:39:21] Philani: Yeah, well done man 👌🏾
[2020/04/17, 21:48:41] Chloë: Looks awesome!
[2020/04/17, 21:50:04] Bangie: I’ll put all my files on my lamp server tomorrow so you guys can access it and you guys can check what I’ve done so far
[2020/04/17, 22:13:36] Reece: Sick
[2020/04/17, 22:20:40] Dino: Sick ✌🏼
[2020/04/17, 22:21:04] Dino: Cool glad you guys like it 🙏🏼 if you have any other ideas or recommendations please let me know so I can try implement them
[2020/04/17, 22:24:03] Reece: I have some ideas on implementing the dragging
[2020/04/17, 22:24:17] Reece: Hit me up when you get to that part
[2020/04/17, 22:24:17] Dino: I’ve practically got it working 😏
[2020/04/17, 22:24:26] Reece: How?
‎[2020/04/17, 22:25:05] Dino: ‎video omitted
[2020/04/17, 22:25:12] Bangie: Did you use something similar to our drawing lab ?
[2020/04/17, 22:25:35] Dino: Yeah I used the installMouseHandler function and just changed it up
[2020/04/17, 22:25:51] Reece: _*Sick x2*_
[2020/04/17, 22:25:55] Bangie: Looks sick bro
[2020/04/17, 22:26:06] Reece: Yeah thats exactly what I was thinking 😂
[2020/04/17, 22:26:09] Dino: 😂 awe guys🙏🏼
[2020/04/17, 22:26:24] Dino: We’re on the same path 😏
[2020/04/17, 22:26:36] Bangie: If you can get the coordinates of the thing once you move it then moving the edge won’t be a problem
[2020/04/17, 22:28:35] Dino: I’ve got the coordinates, that’s how the actual vertex moves. My problem is also updating the vertex’s location within the edges array
[2020/04/17, 22:29:14] Dino: But I think once I get to implementing an adjacency matrix it will I work out, but for now I’m just trying to get it to look like it works properly, and then I’ll play around with the back end stuff
‎[2020/04/17, 22:42:18] Dino: ‎video omitted
[2020/04/17, 22:42:51] Bangie: Nice work bro

[2020/04/20, 13:25:37] Philani: Hey guys, just wanted to check in how everyone else is doing on their parts. And I think that we should maybe have a call with Pravesh this week if everyone is available ✌🏾
[2020/04/20, 13:28:44] Dino: What’s up guys 🙏🏼 I’ve been slacking a bit so I haven’t progressed any further than what I sent in the video. I agree we should have a meeting with Pravesh, help clear things up a bit ✌🏼let’s discuss a time and day that suits everyone and then we’ll ask him
[2020/04/20, 13:30:33] Reece: Yeah in all honesty I haven’t worked on mine in a while either, but I should be done in a couple of days
[2020/04/20, 13:31:47] Reece: I say we all finish up this week, and then on Monday we can have a sprint retrospective and set up another day in the week to talk to Pravesh
[2020/04/20, 13:33:09] Reece: We should show him everything that’s been done and ask him if we’re on the right track and how he recommends we continue going forward
[2020/04/20, 13:34:20] Dino: I back that ✌🏼
[2020/04/20, 13:34:41] Dino: I think maybe we should try do it before the end of the week though, even if we don’t have everything done that we want
[2020/04/20, 13:35:14] Philani: Yeah that sounds like a good idea.
[2020/04/20, 13:36:11] Philani: I'm chilled with either tbh.
[2020/04/20, 13:41:02] Reece: Also, _how_ are we gonna have this meeting with Pravesh 😂
[2020/04/20, 13:41:59] Philani: Skype or whatever I'm assuming 😂🤷🏾‍♂
[2020/04/20, 13:42:59] Reece: We’ll tell him to download house party 👀😂
[2020/04/20, 13:47:08] Philani: 😂😂😂
[2020/04/20, 13:50:43] Dino: Imagine 😂😂
[2020/04/20, 13:51:31] Dino: Microsoft team is pretty decent I think, I’m having a meeting with my CGV group now so I’ll let you know. Otherwise there’s one called discord and it’s really cool because you can share your screen so we can actually show him
[2020/04/20, 13:56:16] Philani: Sounds cool. Let us know 👍🏾
[2020/04/20, 13:59:32] Bangie: I’ve done the graphs , and done the html pages for the student , haven’t done it for the lecturer yet as I’m not quite sure what they can do 😂
I think the GitHub page is also working with regards to circle ci and coveralls , correct me if I’m wrong
[2020/04/20, 14:00:43] Dino: Nice dude ✌🏼 I think it’s working yeah
[2020/04/20, 14:00:59] Bangie: With coveralls as well ??
[2020/04/20, 14:01:22] Bangie: I didn’t do the lecturer side because I’m not sure if they gonna submit questions or just answers or what at this point 😂
[2020/04/20, 14:02:01] Bangie: lamp.ms.wits.ac.za/~s1828201/start.html
[2020/04/21, 18:49:09] Bangie: Guys let’s have a meeting tomorrow to discuss our way forward and the basic structure of how our system is going to work
[2020/04/21, 18:58:47] Dino: Agreed ✌🏼 what time suits everyone? I’m free the whole day
[2020/04/21, 18:59:13] Dino: I’ll email Pravesh and if he replies by then, maybe he can join us and we can chat to him a bit then we can carry on discussing amongst ourselves
[2020/04/21, 18:59:25] Bangie: I know everyone wakes up late so we can do after lunch ?
[2020/04/21, 18:59:36] Jesse: great
[2020/04/21, 19:00:04] Philani: Yeah 👍🏾
[2020/04/21, 19:00:06] Reece: We need to all be on the same page before we talk to Pravesh
[2020/04/21, 19:00:10] Bangie: I think we need some direction now as everyone is lost
[2020/04/21, 19:01:03] Dino: I don’t think so bro. Like I think it will be good to show him what we’ve done so far, even if it’s not complete. Like for the thing I made it will help to know if it’s the same vision he had
[2020/04/21, 23:11:54] Chloë: When are we meeting with Pravesh?
[2020/04/22, 00:55:58] Dino: I emailed him but he hasn’t responded
[2020/04/22, 00:56:25] Chloë: Alrighty
[2020/04/22, 00:56:54] Bangie: I’ll message him in the morning 😂 , what we gonna use for the meeting ?
[2020/04/22, 00:57:02] Bangie: Discord is sick
[2020/04/22, 00:57:28] Chloë: Not zoom 😂 yeah discord would be good, I'm sure he has it. That or MS teams
[2020/04/22, 01:01:11] Dino: Discord is solid 😂✌🏼 zoom is kak
[2020/04/22, 09:40:16] Philani: I rate we use MS teams 😂
[2020/04/22, 10:41:00] Bangie: What time guys more or less
[2020/04/22, 10:45:59] Philani: I'm good with any time after 1 👍🏾
[2020/04/22, 10:46:23] Chloë: Today?
[2020/04/22, 10:46:26] Dino: Should we say 2?✌🏼
[2020/04/22, 10:46:40] Chloë: 2 should be fine
[2020/04/22, 10:49:00] Bangie: Perfect
[2020/04/22, 10:49:25] Jesse: Sik
[2020/04/22, 11:58:02] Chloë: I created a team, here's the code to join: 
fgzahku
[2020/04/22, 11:58:08] Chloë: team name: SD Project - Moodle Graph Marker
[2020/04/22, 12:01:30] Philani: Thanks Chloë 👍🏾
[2020/04/22, 13:33:12] Chloë: So is this thing happening?
[2020/04/22, 13:37:15] Bangie: At 2 right
[2020/04/22, 13:37:31] Chloë: Yeah, and Pravesh?
[2020/04/22, 13:37:35] Philani: I'm available
[2020/04/22, 13:38:20] Bangie: No reply from him 🙈 did he reply to the emails ?
[2020/04/22, 13:38:32] Chloë: Oh lol
[2020/04/22, 13:38:56] Chloë: Okay so then do we just have a team meeting? That's probably a good idea
[2020/04/22, 13:39:33] Dino: Cool thanks ✌🏼
[2020/04/22, 13:39:37] Dino: Nah he didn’t
[2020/04/22, 13:39:40] Dino: Yeah 🙏🏼
[2020/04/22, 13:40:12] Chloë: Sweet so we'll start the call at 2
[2020/04/22, 13:40:38] Chloë: Jesse and Philani have joined
[2020/04/22, 13:40:57] Chloë: We can have the call on discord though if you guys want, I already have that open
[2020/04/22, 13:41:06] Chloë: Teams, I mean
[2020/04/22, 13:42:35] Bangie: Do I have to sign up for this as I’m using my Mac 😂
[2020/04/22, 13:42:14] Dino: Teams is perfect 😇
[2020/04/22, 13:43:34] Philani: Nah just download it and sign up using your school email.
[2020/04/22, 13:44:11] Chloë: Yeah we all get office 365 with our school email, you don't even have to sign up just log in
[2020/04/22, 13:44:23] Jesse: so liht ey
[2020/04/22, 13:44:40] Bangie: Okay lovely I’m downloading it now , I’ll be on soon
[2020/04/22, 13:45:22] Chloë: No need to download as well, you can use it in your browser
[2020/04/22, 13:47:55] Reece: What’s going on
[2020/04/22, 13:48:07] Chloë: Meeting on teams
[2020/04/22, 13:48:16] Chloë: .
[2020/04/22, 13:48:19] Chloë: .
[2020/04/22, 13:48:33] Reece: Okay
[2020/04/22, 13:48:34] Chloë: 2pm, no Pravesh
[2020/04/22, 14:02:36] Bangie: I have to downalod the app 🙈
[2020/04/22, 14:02:57] Bangie: It’s not allowing me to join the meeting
[2020/04/22, 14:04:03] Dino: Awe don’t stress, I’m sure it won’t take long 🙏🏼
[2020/04/22, 15:19:04] Dino: Sorry guys my WiFi cut out, did I miss anything else?
[2020/04/22, 15:20:10] Bangie: Who should I send the generic graph , vertex class to ?
[2020/04/22, 15:20:25] Bangie: I don’t mind converting it to JavaScript and then sending it
[2020/04/22, 15:20:45] Dino: Maybe just push it to the GitHub page
[2020/04/22, 15:20:52] Reece: Do this
[2020/04/22, 15:20:57] Reece: Then push it to github
[2020/04/22, 15:21:33] Dino: Maybe just push it as is, because I feel like  there’s no point converting it. We can rather just use it’s logic when creating our own
[2020/04/22, 15:22:12] Philani: Cool. Didn't Chloë say that she wanted to do it? 🙈
[2020/04/22, 15:22:54] Reece: That could be the one we all use
[2020/04/22, 15:23:09] Dino: I don’t think it would make sense for Chloe to do it, because she wouldn’t exactly be using it. I think the people who are gonna be accessing it should all just work on it
[2020/04/22, 15:23:22] Dino: Yeah that’s true
[2020/04/22, 15:23:55] Philani: Okay fair. I'll take down my mwst stuff in the meantime.
[2020/04/22, 15:24:21] Bangie: I’m just gonna send the generic one for now to GitHub everyone pull it and add what you need like Reece would add color
[2020/04/22, 15:24:33] Dino: 🙏🏼 perfect
[2020/04/22, 15:24:54] Dino: One other thing I was meant to ask, how tf do I do testing for my code??
[2020/04/22, 15:29:34] Reece: Can’t test the things you’re doing
[2020/04/22, 15:32:28] Bangie: Guys I was thinking like with the home page that I created right we could use it and when the user logs  into moodle they go there and it has a drop down list to select which graph you want to do so basically when you press which one it will take you the respective HTML page
[2020/04/22, 15:32:57] Bangie: So there’s an HTML page for each graph so we can create diversity with regards to what each page needs
[2020/04/22, 15:33:08] Bangie: Just a suggestion if I’m wrong just tell me 😂
[2020/04/22, 15:38:50] Dino: That’s also what I thought
[2020/04/22, 15:39:46] Bangie: There’s a stupid way to test it
[2020/04/22, 15:40:21] Dino: And then would each HTML page be a different version of what I’m working on?
[2020/04/22, 15:41:15] Bangie: Exactly but you can just import the same js files just change the main js file for each one
[2020/04/22, 15:42:47] Dino: That could be pretty cool, but it might be a bit redundant and unnecessary because we could achieve the same thing with a drop down on the same page. I think that’s something we should speak to Pravesh about
[2020/04/22, 15:50:35] Bangie: The only reason o thought about doing it is because it adds a bit of design to the page but it’s fine we could just use the drop down
[2020/04/22, 16:09:42] Dino: I added a new wiki page to the GitHub repo, with the notes from the meeting ✌🏼
[2020/04/22, 16:29:37] Bangie: Guys in js there’s no constructor overloading
[2020/04/22, 16:33:23] Bangie: Do you guys want the constructor of the graph class to take in an adjacency matrix or must it just be an attribute
[2020/04/22, 16:33:29] Dino: It’s fine we don’t need it ✌🏼
[2020/04/22, 16:33:48] Dino: I think it must just be an attribute, but maybe take it in, didn’t really think about it...
[2020/04/22, 16:34:12] Bangie: Okay I just have it as a parameter in the constructor for now
[2020/04/22, 16:34:17] Dino: Awe
[2020/04/22, 16:39:19] Bangie: I thought we needed it for some objects that don’t need a weight and for some objects that don’t need color
[2020/04/22, 16:40:03] Dino: I think we could just put a null value
[2020/04/22, 16:41:50] Bangie: Okay so I’ll add that , for the edge class I created the draw edge function but I left it blank because you know what to put in there right
[2020/04/22, 16:42:28] Dino: Awe 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[2020/04/22, 16:48:18] Bangie: I made one it’s on GitHub now , not sure if it’s correct just check what you need to add and shit
[2020/04/22, 16:49:28] Bangie: I made a mistake I’m just fixing it quickly
[2020/04/22, 17:27:26] Bangie: Just change the addEdge function in the graph class as it adds two vertices to the edge array when it should actually add an edge so create an edge object in that function and add it
[2020/04/22, 17:28:51] Dino: Sweet thanks bro ✌🏼
[2020/04/23, 12:18:26] Dino: Are we having a meeting with Pravesh today?
[2020/04/23, 12:23:48] Bangie: I’m hurt he left me on read 😂
[2020/04/23, 12:25:55] Dino: Rough 😂😂
[2020/04/23, 12:42:05] Jesse: 😂
[2020/04/23, 13:03:40] Philani: So then do we actually need to meet for today?
[2020/04/23, 13:03:49] Philani: If Pravesh won't be here.
[2020/04/23, 13:59:42] Chloë: We could have it nowish if everyone's around
[2020/04/23, 14:02:00] Jesse: I'll be around in 30
[2020/04/23, 14:02:20] Chloë: That's alright for me too
[2020/04/23, 14:02:21] Jesse: What do we want to talk about?
[2020/04/23, 14:02:54] Chloë: Yeah let's just make sure there is actually something someone wants to say 🤣
[2020/04/23, 14:12:37] Jesse: 😂😂
[2020/04/23, 14:13:37] Jesse: Bangie and I just want to confirm whether we'll store an adjacency matrix/adjaceny list?
[2020/04/23, 14:14:53] Philani: I'm good, I don't have anything 😂
[2020/04/23, 14:15:38] Chloë: Matrix, it's the most versatile for everyone's algorithms. If I remember correctly from what was said yesterday?
[2020/04/23, 14:15:41] Chloë: Same
[2020/04/23, 14:15:59] Jesse: Cool cool
[2020/04/23, 14:27:35] Dino: Me neither 😂
[2020/04/23, 14:27:43] Dino: Yeah 🙏🏼
[2020/04/23, 14:32:36] Bangie: I emailed a graph class to Jesse I can’t access GitHub strangely , so Jesses just gonna fix whatever he sees fit and put it on GitHub.  The ones that are there aren’t complete
[2020/04/23, 14:32:59] Dino: Cool ✌🏼
[2020/04/23, 14:33:35] Chloë: Awesome, is that everything for the day then?
[2020/04/23, 14:33:42] Jesse: I can get it done by tonight sometime hopefully
[2020/04/23, 14:34:25] Bangie: The one I sent you will work for dijkstra because I implemented dijkstra in there
[2020/04/24, 00:14:11] Jesse: I'm quite tired guys, I'll will finish this class off in the morning
[2020/04/24, 00:15:32] Reece: min
[2020/04/24, 00:16:08] Jesse: :)
[2020/04/24, 00:16:10] Jesse: :(
[2020/04/24, 11:35:43] Jesse: Just working with dino to figure something out before I'm done :)
[2020/04/24, 12:01:40] Dino: I pushed it Jesse✌🏼
[2020/04/24, 12:02:24] Jesse: 👌👌👌
[2020/04/24, 16:06:10] Jesse: Okay I think I'm done, but I just want to test it before I upload to gitHub. If anyone of you want to see it tho and give feed back if anything is missing etc let me know.
[2020/04/24, 16:06:23] Jesse: I'll share it with you
[2020/04/24, 16:14:12] Jesse: It might take me a while to test alles, there is quite a bit of stuff
[2020/04/25, 15:42:22] Jesse: Alright I've uploaded the graph class!
[2020/04/25, 15:46:06] Reece: Dankie Jessica
[2020/04/26, 12:53:27] Dino: Cool thanks bro ✌🏼
[2020/04/26, 12:58:03] Jesse: Pleasure 🙃 thank bangie as well
[2020/04/26, 15:50:02] Chloë: Guys is anyone else having issues connecting to LAMP?
[2020/04/26, 18:12:55] Dino: Thanks so much guys 🙏🏼I’ve got the actual dragging and stuff working using your classes but there’s lots of redundant and bad code on my side so I need to sort that out. 

Can I just ask why you used exports and require? Because unless I comment that out it doesn’t actually work for me
[2020/04/26, 18:13:01] Dino: I haven’t tried 🙈😂
[2020/04/26, 18:14:24] Jesse: Oh weird. tbh I dunno you'd have to ask bangie about that 1 xD
[2020/04/26, 18:15:25] Dino: Okay awe 😂 Bangie remember we had this discussion when I needed your help, and then you said I didn’t actually have to do anything funny to create an instance of the class? So that’s basically what’s happening again
[2020/04/26, 18:16:03] Bangie: Exports was just for us testing the classes worked together because we were using node , but now we using HTML so you can just do it like before bro
[2020/04/26, 18:16:27] Jesse: ohh I see
[2020/04/26, 18:17:24] Bangie: So in HTML you just have to say <script src=“path to js file”></script>
And make sure this is before your main code
[2020/04/26, 18:18:08] Dino: Awe that makes sense. So can I just remove those lines? The export and require?
[2020/04/26, 18:19:01] Bangie: Yeah as long as you include the other scripts before the main script
[2020/04/26, 18:19:42] Dino: Yeah I have ✌🏼 but do you not still need them for testing?
[2020/04/26, 18:20:55] Jesse: Well I tested it all already so everything should be working
[2020/04/26, 18:21:01] Jesse: so I guess you can remove it
[2020/04/26, 18:21:25] Bangie: Nahh you can remove it , if we need to test anything else it’s simple lines of code
[2020/04/26, 18:21:33] Jesse: Just read through the methods we provided btw dino so you dont have to rewrite code
[2020/04/26, 18:21:40] Bangie: Jesse hit me up when you want to write all the tests
[2020/04/26, 18:21:48] Jesse: Will do bro
[2020/04/26, 18:21:53] Jesse: just working on ML rn
[2020/04/26, 18:34:59] Chloë: Okay 😂 cause I wanted to see if I could set up moodle there
[2020/04/26, 18:38:00] Bangie: Chloe lamp is working on my side I can login
[2020/04/26, 18:38:18] Chloë: Awesome
[2020/04/26, 19:54:02] Reece: Thanks Jesse and Gulabjamun
[2020/04/26, 19:54:28] Reece: Great class, this is
[2020/04/26, 19:54:37] Jesse: ❤️
[2020/04/26, 19:54:38] Chloë: Wow 😂
[2020/04/26, 22:28:55] Reece: Pushed the graph colouring marker to the repo
[2020/04/26, 22:29:55] Reece: Haven’t really tested it so feel free to go through it and make sure it works properly
[2020/04/26, 22:33:18] Reece: @27835072064 you should be able to add your marking algorithm as a function in the Marker.js file as well
[2020/04/26, 22:33:28] Reece: @27795810646 you do you bro
[2020/04/26, 22:35:12] Jesse: 👌
[2020/04/26, 22:39:39] Dino: And then do I just add some sort of “Submit” button that sends the adjacency matrix to that function to check it?
[2020/04/26, 22:40:12] Reece: Check the Test.html file
[2020/04/26, 22:40:37] Reece: And access it the same way that I do
[2020/04/26, 22:41:31] Reece: You just need to instantiate a Marker
[2020/04/26, 22:41:44] Reece: And then you can use the Marking function
[2020/04/26, 22:42:54] Dino: 🙏🏼✌🏼
[2020/04/26, 22:46:09] Reece: PS @27794187505 you’re gonna need to incorporate vertex colour and edge weight in the UI in order to use the class
[2020/04/26, 22:47:20] Reece: And then set them to 0 as default if they’re not relevant
[2020/04/26, 22:49:57] Jesse: I think I can change things to automatically set them to zero as dedault if no color/edge weight is given as a parameter
[2020/04/26, 22:50:16] Reece: Honestly no need bro
[2020/04/26, 22:51:08] Reece: Adding an extra comma and a zero isn’t the end of the world
[2020/04/26, 22:51:15] Dino: Yebo I’ll work on that 🙏🏼
[2020/04/26, 22:51:39] Dino: Agreed ✌🏼 we can do that kinda fine tuning stuff in second semester
[2020/04/26, 23:22:19] Jesse: okay cool :)
[2020/04/27, 04:30:59] Bangie: Actually you can do this by just setting their values in the constructor to zero so if no color or weight is passed it gets set to 0
[2020/04/27, 11:38:04] Chloë: Hey @27835072064 have you sent that email to Rylan with our group info? There was an email asking about device availability etc
‎[2020/04/27, 11:39:48] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/04/27, 11:40:02] Chloë: Okay sweet, thanks Philani
[2020/04/27, 11:40:10] Philani: No stress ✌🏾
[2020/04/27, 11:43:52] Dino: Thanks scrum master 😉
[2020/04/27, 11:47:42] Philani: Anytime 😌
[2020/04/27, 11:57:58] Jesse: thanks boii
[2020/04/27, 15:36:23] Chloë: Okay so we successfully have an empty plugin installed, next thing is to set it up on our virtual machine. I'm having issues connecting to LAMP but Bangie said we can use his
[2020/04/28, 13:13:22] Philani: Okay, dope 🙏🏾
‎[2020/04/28, 13:13:27] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/04/28, 14:30:29] Chloë: 👍🏼
[2020/04/28, 14:30:37] Dino: Sick ✌🏼
[2020/04/28, 16:23:18] Dino: Bangie has Pravesh still not replied? He hasn’t replied to my email
[2020/04/28, 16:50:06] Chloë: Big oof
[2020/04/28, 16:50:50] Chloë: Well if he's abandoned us, we kind of know what we *should* be doing so I rate we carry on, and if he wants anything changed later on I don't think they can hold that against us
[2020/04/28, 16:51:12] Chloë: It's already so hard to get anything done on this as it is, under these circumstances
[2020/04/28, 16:58:36] Dino: Very true, and I think our stuff is what he wanted, lol hopefully
[2020/04/28, 16:59:28] Bangie: Nahh bro
[2020/04/28, 17:40:13] Chloë: And he's been replying to other things, someone from the tutor group emailed him and he responded
[2020/04/28, 17:40:23] Chloë: So that feels kinda personal 😂
[2020/04/28, 17:40:54] Bangie: Wow 😂 Pravesh
[2020/04/28, 17:41:14] Chloë: Well I'm not sure if it was an email or a whatsapp, but either way 👀
[2020/04/28, 17:53:53] Reece: I never thought I’d ever say this about Pravesh
[2020/04/28, 17:53:54] Reece: But
[2020/04/28, 17:53:56] Reece: What a poes
[2020/04/28, 18:33:23] Chloë: Some hopefully helpful stuff for javascript:
[2020/04/28, 18:33:25] Chloë: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Javascript_Modules
‎[2020/04/29, 13:42:56] Jesse: ‎image omitted
[2020/04/29, 14:18:22] Dino: Wow spot on 😂😂
[2020/04/29, 17:59:32] Dino: Seems pretty unfair to tell us today that the next sprint is next Monday??😂
[2020/04/29, 18:00:11] Chloë: It does, but also we're not in too bad of a spot
[2020/04/29, 18:00:20] Chloë: Where was this said?
[2020/04/29, 18:10:34] Bangie: We’re at a good spot , I mean we can show the user being able to enter nodes and the draggable feature 
We can also show all our graph markers are functioning
[2020/04/29, 18:11:54] Bangie: Jesse we can hit the tests for the different js files this weekend so when we show our home page of the repo it can show that our tests are passing
[2020/04/29, 18:30:30] Bangie: There’s a lot of files on the repo so which is the right JavaScript files that we have to write tests for ??
[2020/04/29, 19:08:24] Dino: True actually ✌🏼 do you rate there’s any more admin shit we have to show? Like taiga, coveralls, that kind stuff
[2020/04/29, 19:08:47] Chloë: Let's just review things like that throughout the week
[2020/04/29, 19:08:52] Dino: The correct ones are in the folder that Jesse made that say “final” or something
[2020/04/29, 19:08:53] Chloë: Make absolutely sure
[2020/04/29, 19:09:13] Bangie: Coveralls we’ll sort out when we write the tests
[2020/04/29, 19:09:24] Chloë: Shouldn't we delete the old ones? Or make a new branch at least
[2020/04/29, 19:10:21] Bangie: Yeah I think we should clear what we don’t need but we must leave those json files there as it’s the configuration file for running the tests
[2020/04/29, 19:10:55] Chloë: So let's get on teams tomorrow and sort that out
[2020/04/29, 19:11:06] Chloë: I want to start putting things together in the actual plugin
[2020/04/29, 19:11:25] Chloë: Testing the javascript in moodle, cause we haven't done that yet
[2020/04/29, 19:14:36] Bangie: What file types does moodle accept ??
[2020/04/29, 19:15:07] Chloë: Most things are done through php, but they do have support for javascript
[2020/04/29, 19:15:19] Chloë: I sent an article to the group yesterday I think
[2020/04/29, 19:16:35] Bangie: Okay php is perfect , like when I was designing web pages , normally they supposed to be HTML but because I needed the database I just changed the extension to php and it works exactly the same as an HTML page ( running it in a browser , having script tags for JavaScript code
[2020/04/29, 19:18:23] Bangie: Like chloe you can check in my lamp server in the public_html folder there’s a couple of php files you can open it in an editor on your computer and see that it’s exactly like an HTML file just named with the php extension
[2020/04/29, 19:18:39] Chloë: Oh sweet that's perfect
[2020/04/29, 19:19:07] Chloë: Are the things on your LAMP server for the project?
[2020/04/29, 19:20:08] Bangie: No there’s files in the public_html folder that were supposed to be for the project if shun didn’t sort out the server and we had to display our project as an app
[2020/04/29, 19:20:22] Chloë: Ahhhh okay
[2020/04/29, 19:21:14] Bangie: The nice things about our files having the php extension is that it allows us to pass data we get from the database from one php file to the next
[2020/04/29, 19:21:31] Bangie: So similar to how we passed data from one android page to another using intent
[2020/04/29, 19:36:17] Bangie: We mustn’t also forget to do that release thing on GitHub 😂
[2020/04/29, 20:00:18] Bangie: Maybe we should have a meeting on Saturday or Sunday and see if we have everything ?
[2020/04/29, 20:18:54] Chloë: It should probably be before that hey 😂
[2020/04/29, 20:19:04] Chloë: Yesss
[2020/04/29, 20:19:43] Bangie: Friday ?
[2020/04/29, 20:20:23] Bangie: We can go through the rubric and see if we have everything
[2020/04/29, 20:23:24] Chloë: Sounds good to me
[2020/04/29, 21:38:23] Dino: Sounds good 🤞🏼
[2020/04/29, 21:39:00] Dino: Cool 🙏🏼 so then there’s no point meeting tomorrow, we’ll just do Friday
[2020/04/30, 20:01:27] Chloë: Okay guys our slot with Pierce is at 3pm on Monday
[2020/04/30, 20:01:46] Chloë: He sent an invitation out, just let me know if you got it so I can let him know
[2020/04/30, 20:02:13] Dino: I got it ✌🏼
[2020/04/30, 20:02:35] Bangie: I got it
[2020/04/30, 20:03:49] Philani: Got it 👍🏾
[2020/04/30, 20:07:20] Reece: Who
[2020/04/30, 20:07:32] Chloë: Head coms tutor
[2020/04/30, 20:07:52] Chloë: He is who we have now 😂 which is hectic because he's going to actually know what's klapping
[2020/04/30, 20:08:40] Dino: At least he’ll know what a graph is
[2020/04/30, 20:08:50] Reece: Grass is always greener on the other side hey 😂
[2020/04/30, 20:09:01] Reece: I got the email
[2020/04/30, 20:09:05] Chloë: 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
[2020/04/30, 20:09:15] Chloë: Awesome, thanks guys
[2020/04/30, 20:09:54] Jesse: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/04/30, 20:41:53] Bangie: It may have been better to have the other guy who didn’t know his left from his right 😂
[2020/04/30, 20:54:15] Chloë: Maybe hey 🤣
[2020/05/01, 10:51:24] Bangie: Guys what time are we meeting today
[2020/05/01, 10:54:38] Philani: I'm chilled with 2 👍🏾
[2020/05/01, 10:54:57] Bangie: Same here
[2020/05/01, 10:59:11] Dino: Same ✌🏼
[2020/05/01, 11:03:17] Jesse: 👌🔥
[2020/05/01, 11:04:24] Jesse: Linear regression lab due today at 2
[2020/05/01, 11:04:49] Jesse: If Anyone hasn't done it I can just put your student number on mine
[2020/05/01, 11:18:43] Dino: Thanks bro but I’ve done most of it so I’m just gonna submit what I have 🙏🏼
[2020/05/01, 11:24:06] Chloë: Oh no
[2020/05/01, 11:24:44] Chloë: I think I have it mostly done as well but definitely not finished 😂
[2020/05/01, 11:41:18] Jesse: 👌
[2020/05/01, 11:41:29] Jesse: Just let me know if you change your mind
[2020/05/01, 11:42:08] Reece: I’ll take that deal 👀
[2020/05/01, 11:42:32] Jesse: 🤙
[2020/05/01, 11:44:55] Reece: Wait don’t 😂
[2020/05/01, 11:45:12] Reece: I think Razeen already added my name to his
[2020/05/01, 11:46:38] Dino: Jesse bro would you be happy to send me your code anyway please?🙏🏼 I probably won’t even look at it today, but I had the wrong idea at first so it was messed up then when I looked at Benji’s code I managed to fix a lot of mine but there’s still some stuff that doesn’t look right, so maybe if I look at yours it will make more sense 🙈
[2020/05/01, 11:47:33] Chloë: Lol same please, Philani's submitted for the group already but I just wanna take a look
[2020/05/01, 11:48:27] Jesse: Yes for sure
[2020/05/01, 11:48:38] Jesse: When I'm finished I'll let you know
[2020/05/01, 11:56:10] Chloë: Thanks Jesse 🔥
[2020/05/01, 13:03:36] Dino: Awesome thanks bro 🙏🏼
[2020/05/01, 13:15:33] Jesse: I'll be done in like 15
[2020/05/01, 13:40:25] Reece: Guys can we have the meeting at 3?
[2020/05/01, 13:40:55] Chloë: It doesn't make a difference to me really 🤷🏽‍♀️
[2020/05/01, 13:40:58] Reece: I need to go to the shop
[2020/05/01, 13:41:13] Dino: That’s cool with me ✌🏼
[2020/05/01, 13:41:25] Reece: Shot
‎[2020/05/01, 13:45:24] Bangie: ‎image omitted
‎[2020/05/01, 13:49:51] Jesse: Linear Regression.pdf • ‎12 pages ‎document omitted
[2020/05/01, 13:49:55] Jesse: sorry I just finished
[2020/05/01, 13:56:36] Jesse: I'll only be able to stay in the meeting for about 30 mins, I have to tutor
[2020/05/01, 14:01:33] Chloë: Damn 👌🏼
[2020/05/01, 14:49:05] Jesse: 🙏😂
[2020/05/01, 14:56:24] Dino: Thanks so much bro 🙏🏼
[2020/05/01, 14:57:03] Jesse: Sorry I finished do late
[2020/05/01, 14:57:05] Jesse: So
[2020/05/01, 14:57:37] Jesse: But it's a pleasure 😝
[2020/05/01, 14:57:42] Dino: Nah not a problem, I didn’t want it submit, just to make my code better more for the project anyway ✌🏼
[2020/05/01, 14:58:52] Bangie: We not allowed to do linear regression for the project bro
[2020/05/01, 14:59:35] Jesse: we starting this meeting? :))
[2020/05/01, 14:59:43] Chloë: Are we ready?
[2020/05/01, 14:59:49] Dino: Howcome? 
Well I still need to be able to do it to progress to logistic and then to neural nets
[2020/05/01, 14:59:58] Dino: I’m on meets ✌🏼
[2020/05/01, 15:00:07] Bangie: It’s a regression problem not classification
[2020/05/01, 15:01:06] Reece: On my way
[2020/05/01, 15:01:08] Dino: Eish true
[2020/05/01, 15:01:59] Chloë: https://jinglescode.github.io/datascience/2019/05/07/why-linear-regression-is-not-suitable-for-classification/
[2020/05/01, 15:02:20] Dino: Thanks Chloe, appreciate it 😂🙏🏼
[2020/05/01, 15:02:22] Chloë: You can technically use it, and for some problems it may be fine but it's not going to be the best
‎[2020/05/01, 15:03:10] Jesse: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/01, 15:03:18] Chloë: Lol no problem 😂 cause I literally did an online example of linear regression for classification, it's not impossible it's just not the best to use. idk why we're *not allowed* to use it though
[2020/05/03, 13:01:07] Bangie: Guys I’m trying everything to get coveralls to work
[2020/05/03, 13:01:20] Bangie: I legit copied the shit from my working repo to ours and it doesn’t work
[2020/05/03, 13:15:47] Bangie: Anyone know the password for our coveralls page ?
[2020/05/03, 13:34:13] Philani: Who made the page? I'm sure they would know.
[2020/05/03, 13:34:53] Dino: I did, but it’s linked to my GitHub, so I didn’t actually have to enter a password, but I’ll give you my GitHub login bangie ✌🏼
[2020/05/03, 13:38:50] Jesse: hey guys
[2020/05/03, 13:38:56] Jesse: what time is our meeting tomo
[2020/05/03, 13:54:15] Jesse: Nvm
[2020/05/03, 16:43:46] Bangie: Coverage is 99 now
[2020/05/03, 16:43:54] Jesse: damn
[2020/05/03, 16:43:57] Jesse: thats legit
[2020/05/03, 16:44:29] Bangie: The badge doesn’t show the right amount
[2020/05/03, 16:44:37] Bangie: Press on it and you’ll see the actual value
[2020/05/03, 16:45:21] Philani: Awe, thanks Goolam 💪🏾
[2020/05/03, 17:00:27] Bangie: No stress bro
[2020/05/03, 17:10:01] Chloë: Ahhh sick ✨ thanks Bangie
[2020/05/03, 17:54:58] Dino: Dooope 😏
[2020/05/03, 17:55:08] Dino: Thanks so much man 🙏🏼
[2020/05/03, 17:56:11] Bangie: No stress , but everyone’s doing their shit to make this work 🤞
[2020/05/03, 20:11:04] Jesse: Guys I don't know if I'll be able to get everything done before the meeting tomo, my power just went out and I'm not sure how long it'll be out for 😪 I'm sorry
[2020/05/03, 20:11:29] Dino: What all did you need to do bro?
[2020/05/03, 20:11:59] Jesse: The testing on my dfs/bfs/djikstra checkers
[2020/05/03, 20:12:17] Jesse: But I got the testing on the main graph class done atleast
[2020/05/03, 20:13:53] Bangie: Don’t stress , we have the tests for mwst and graph coloring so that’s okay
[2020/05/03, 20:18:28] Jesse: Okay awe ❤️ I will try get it done as soon as possible
[2020/05/03, 20:26:56] Chloë: Awww dude don't worry about it, tomorrow's meeting is also only at 3pm anyways
[2020/05/03, 20:27:36] Dino: I don’t think you need to stress too much dude. Just say you added the code this morning and haven’t had time to write tests or something 😂
[2020/05/03, 20:28:59] Philani: Yeah don't stress too much about it, bro ✌🏾
[2020/05/03, 20:29:20] Jesse: Thanks guys ❤️
[2020/05/04, 10:27:55] Bangie: Guys for some weird reason the graph final class was failing so I removed them from the repo but they are in the graph coloring and mwst folders
[2020/05/04, 10:59:56] Dino: Won’t that mess with all our code?🥺
[2020/05/04, 11:18:47] Philani: It doesn't seem to mess with it cause our badge still says passing.
[2020/05/04, 11:19:13] Philani: Also, who's screen are we gonna use? And do we have eveything sorted for the retrospective?
[2020/05/04, 11:22:41] Bangie: I don’t think so because there were no other files with that folder
[2020/05/04, 11:22:54] Bangie: It would’ve messed up if like all the files were in one folder
[2020/05/04, 14:24:02] Dino: Okay cool ✌🏼
[2020/05/04, 14:24:10] Dino: I feel like Bangie knows the most?
[2020/05/04, 14:30:53] Chloë: Considering he knows what coveralls are and how to do the thing, yes 😂🔥
[2020/05/04, 14:31:02] Chloë: And he did the diagrams
[2020/05/04, 14:31:55] Reece: Agreed
[2020/05/04, 14:32:26] Reece: But we can’t expect him to present everything
[2020/05/04, 14:32:44] Reece: I think we need a POA here
[2020/05/04, 14:35:02] Dino: I’ll show the interface if he wants to see it, but I don’t know if they actually care about that stuff
[2020/05/04, 14:35:16] Bangie: Yeah guys I can explain the coveralls part sure but the plugin and Dino’s part I won’t be able to explain
[2020/05/04, 14:36:02] Reece: I’m sure they do 😂 .... we should definitely show it to him
[2020/05/04, 14:36:55] Reece: Then next sprint after we make improvements he’ll be able to see that we’re progressing
[2020/05/04, 14:38:08] Reece: Should we all just show the parts we did?
[2020/05/04, 14:38:41] Reece: So Chloe can show him the plugin, Dino the interface, Philani, Jesse and I the markers, and Goolam the rest?
[2020/05/04, 14:39:08] Philani: That seems fine to me
[2020/05/04, 14:39:26] Jesse: Okeh
[2020/05/04, 14:39:34] Reece: And then we also have to show proof of our sprint meetings and stuff
[2020/05/04, 14:39:50] Reece: As well as the user stories on taiga
[2020/05/04, 14:40:54] Philani: We can show Microsoft Teams meetings, like the length of them when someone shares the screen.
[2020/05/04, 14:41:14] Philani: And I guess we could do the same on Taiga. Did everyone close their tasks on Taiga?
[2020/05/04, 14:41:19] Reece: How we gonna show him our WhatsApp chat though 😂
[2020/05/04, 14:41:20] Philani: For this sprint
[2020/05/04, 14:41:30] Philani: WhatsApp Web
[2020/05/04, 14:41:51] Chloë: I did, but we should double check
[2020/05/04, 14:41:55] Chloë: 👌🏼
[2020/05/04, 14:44:59] Bangie: Who’s screen are we gonna show or we gonna change throughout ?
[2020/05/04, 14:45:48] Dino: I think we should change
[2020/05/04, 14:46:10] Dino: Joh guys Taiga confuses me, I think I did but please can someone check if I did it properly 😂
[2020/05/04, 14:46:31] Reece: I’m on Taiga
‎[2020/05/04, 14:46:45] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/04, 14:48:14] Reece: What the actual fuck is going on here 😂
[2020/05/04, 14:52:10] Dino: 😂😂😂
‎[2020/05/04, 14:59:32] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/04, 15:00:18] Reece: Did you remove the extra stuff from the top and bottom?
[2020/05/04, 15:00:39] Dino: Nah I just tried to pull the repository
[2020/05/04, 15:07:06] Dino: Shit guys I’m sitting here laughing my ass off 😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/04, 15:07:16] Jesse: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/04, 15:07:18] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/04, 15:10:49] Chloë: Oh no 😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/04, 15:14:44] Dino: My graph generator isn’t working guys, please all check yours and see if it’s working 😭
[2020/05/04, 15:18:03] Dino: Guys !! 🥺
[2020/05/04, 15:20:10] Philani: Eish. I'll try now
[2020/05/04, 15:22:28] Dino: Got it
[2020/05/04, 15:22:50] Philani: Awe 🙏🏾
[2020/05/04, 15:23:51] Dino: Chloe this thing is fire 😍😍
[2020/05/04, 15:24:58] Chloë: Ah hectic dude it's basically just a template 😂 but yoh it took forever to get it to work
[2020/05/04, 15:36:40] Jesse: Reece?
[2020/05/06, 12:14:22] Dino: Which Graph, Edge, Vertex classes am I supposed to be working with? I lost all my local work because the files I was working on were deleted
[2020/05/06, 12:16:31] Bangie: You can look in the folder mwst or graph coloring it should be in there
[2020/05/06, 12:17:42] Dino: But there’s replicates of all of them? Can’t we just have 1 copy?
[2020/05/06, 12:18:06] Reece: To what end
[2020/05/06, 12:18:10] Chloë: Maybe we should have a meeting to clean it up
[2020/05/06, 12:18:21] Chloë: Because we need to know which one to work with
[2020/05/06, 12:18:51] Chloë: I.e. someone screenshares and deletes things and everyone else puts in their 2 cents for what has to stay
[2020/05/06, 12:19:20] Bangie: The reason we have them in all those folders is because when running the tests we needed them 
So we can either put all of them into one folder with all the markers
[2020/05/06, 12:20:10] Dino: Exactly. Like I was working on some but then before the meeting it wasn’t working because the files weren’t there any more, so I reverted something and now I lost all the work I did
[2020/05/06, 12:20:33] Reece: Jesse has already added everything everyone needs to the class
[2020/05/06, 12:20:49] Chloë: But there are too many copies is the point
[2020/05/06, 12:20:49] Reece: So there might be multiple copies
[2020/05/06, 12:20:57] Reece: But it’s exactly the same
[2020/05/06, 12:21:04] Dino: There’s a bunch of classes though, that’s what I’m saying
[2020/05/06, 12:21:07] Chloë: Right now our repo looks like pure ass, and nobody completely knows what is what
[2020/05/06, 12:21:27] Dino: And the one I was working with got deleted
[2020/05/06, 12:21:33] Reece: No true 😂
[2020/05/06, 12:21:40] Dino: ☝🏻
[2020/05/06, 12:23:02] Bangie: In order for all our tests to still work we’ll need all markers and classes in one folder 
Because all the markers are in different folders right now we need the classes to be in all the folders so the tests could pass
[2020/05/06, 12:23:32] Dino: So then let’s just put everything in one folder?
[2020/05/06, 12:23:36] Chloë: That's fine, but can we just organise it a bit
[2020/05/06, 12:23:46] Bangie: Exactly bro
[2020/05/06, 12:24:07] Bangie: But then your copy of the classes can’t have the exports and require shit
[2020/05/06, 12:24:23] Chloë: Cause I also need to know what I need to actually put into the plugin
[2020/05/06, 12:24:43] Dino: Okay that’s fine, then I’ll make a copy of them and put then in a folder with the interface stuff
[2020/05/06, 12:25:26] Dino: But please guys if you have to make changes like that in the GitHub page just let us know, because it’s pretty frustrating that now I have to go redo shit because I had to rollback so that I could present a working thing
[2020/05/06, 12:26:23] Chloë: Probably the answer to this is using multiple branches
[2020/05/06, 12:27:01] Dino: Also true, I feel like none of us have done that because we don’t know how to use GitHub properly 😂
[2020/05/06, 12:27:36] Reece: Yeah lol
[2020/05/06, 12:27:44] Chloë: We all went into this blind 😂 but now that we have a bit of time to the next due date we might as well fix things up
[2020/05/06, 12:27:46] Reece: We might as well just be using a shared drive
[2020/05/06, 12:27:55] Chloë: Otherwise it'll have to wait for the holiday
[2020/05/06, 12:30:06] Dino: agreed
[2020/05/06, 18:02:38] Dino: I fixed the interface. All the files I need are in the Graph Generator folder
[2020/05/06, 18:19:35] Chloë: Thanks Dino
[2020/05/06, 18:20:00] Chloë: So I suppose this is what I should focus on integrating into the plugin for this sprint?
[2020/05/06, 18:20:18] Reece: Sick^2
[2020/05/06, 21:14:56] Dino: I guess so 🙏🏼😂
‎[2020/05/11, 17:31:32] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/11, 17:32:23] Reece: Ayo
[2020/05/11, 17:32:51] Dino: Sick
[2020/05/11, 17:34:02] Dino: Guys I had a realization. This project isn’t about the software we’re developing, it’s about how we’re doing it. They literally don’t even mark our program/code. So we really need to focus on the other shit to get the marks. Because in the end Pravesh doesn’t even mark us, so if our code isn’t 100% complete we can still do well 😂 it’s kinda dumb and annoying but it is what it is
[2020/05/11, 17:34:15] Chloë: _wut_
[2020/05/11, 17:34:43] Reece: x2
[2020/05/11, 17:34:57] Chloë: Okay then 😂😂😂 Then I guess we focus on documentation and actually doing the things to be done on Taiga?
[2020/05/11, 17:35:07] Dino: Exactly
[2020/05/11, 17:35:11] Chloë: And get a proper wiki or at least a readme on github
[2020/05/11, 17:36:01] Dino: Think about it, every group is doing something completely different so they can’t mark us based on what we’re actually making, and they’re not. Every retrospective is about the admin and documentation and testing and whatnot. Like we always show the tutor our code but they never actually really care about it
[2020/05/11, 17:36:25] Chloë: That is very true.........
[2020/05/11, 17:36:53] Reece: What Dino is saying is
[2020/05/11, 17:36:59] Reece: We hardcode everything
[2020/05/11, 17:37:12] Dino: Spot on
[2020/05/11, 17:37:17] Reece: Show them out predetermined demo
[2020/05/11, 17:37:27] Chloë: Who cares if documentation doesn't match the final product 😂😂😂
[2020/05/11, 17:37:31] Reece: And gloss over the code when we present
[2020/05/11, 17:37:41] Dino: Tests and coverage need to be 💯💯
[2020/05/11, 17:37:49] Chloë: I mean.... *we* might care if we have to work on it later this year
[2020/05/11, 17:38:23] Dino: we don’t have much more to do for the code anyway but I think we really need to aim for marks on the other stuff
[2020/05/11, 17:38:44] Reece: I’d say we kinda do though
[2020/05/11, 17:39:00] Reece: Like nothing works together yet
[2020/05/11, 17:39:27] Reece: And there’s the issues of all the additional information we need to obtain, store and manage
[2020/05/11, 17:39:46] Chloë: We really do
[2020/05/11, 17:39:47] Dino: Also true
[2020/05/11, 17:40:03] Chloë: Right now we have a program entirely separate to our plugin
[2020/05/11, 17:40:17] Dino: If pravesh could pull through it would be great.... because we need some guidance from that man
[2020/05/11, 17:40:36] Reece: That guy 😂
[2020/05/11, 17:40:39] Reece: Such a disappointment
[2020/05/11, 17:40:54] Bangie: Is Pravesh even going to mark our thing ?
[2020/05/11, 17:40:57] Chloë: This shouldn't be bad, all we actually need to do for a graph assignment plugin is store questions and be able to mark submissions, anything else doesn't actually need to be stored
[2020/05/11, 17:41:29] Chloë: If you look at other types of assignment plugins for Moodle they don't do anything other than that, admin is on the actual Moodle core side
[2020/05/11, 17:41:41] Chloë: Mans has disappeared so I find it unlikely
[2020/05/11, 17:41:54] Chloë: Anything at all would be nice :(((((
[2020/05/11, 17:42:13] Reece: I feel like we could probably log a complaint
[2020/05/11, 17:42:23] Chloë: The Moodle documentation is seriously unhelpful, everything leads down a rabbit hole of conflicting information
[2020/05/11, 17:42:36] Chloë: We literally don't have a client right now guys
[2020/05/11, 17:42:47] Reece: And that’s a rather big issue
[2020/05/11, 17:42:49] Philani: So true 😂
[2020/05/11, 17:42:49] Dino: console.log(“this man is failing us”)
[2020/05/11, 17:42:53] Chloë: .....so why are we doing this? 😂
[2020/05/11, 17:43:06] Reece: Because we have to
[2020/05/11, 17:43:07] Dino: Deep chats 😂😂
[2020/05/11, 17:43:08] Chloë: Common sense would dictate that work stops if your client ups and leaves
[2020/05/11, 17:43:15] Philani: This is  really good point 😅
[2020/05/11, 17:43:27] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/11, 17:43:30] Bangie: Like if he’s not marking it for now why the f does it need to be a moodle plug in
[2020/05/11, 17:43:30] Reece: If _anything_ we should just do this and we deserve 100%
[2020/05/11, 17:43:34] Reece: Ultra realism
[2020/05/11, 17:43:41] Reece: We’ll be commended
[2020/05/11, 17:43:47] Dino: Well I don’t know about you guys but I fucking love graph marking? I wake up every morning eager to input a graph and see that “correct” message 🤤🤤🤤 it gives me a purpose
[2020/05/11, 17:44:00] Chloë: No good project manager would make their team continue working for no reason
[2020/05/11, 17:44:13] Philani: Graph marking is the reason I'm at Wits tbh
[2020/05/11, 17:44:17] Chloë: That shit fucks *heavy*
[2020/05/11, 17:44:29] Dino: 😂😂😂
[2020/05/11, 17:44:34] Reece: Same ... I would’ve probably kicked out the rope and chair by now if it weren’t for this project
[2020/05/11, 17:44:58] Philani: Cmon Chloë. You're mean to say, "I fuck heavy with this shit" get it right 😂😂
[2020/05/11, 17:45:15] Reece: First Pravesh now Chloe
[2020/05/11, 17:45:19] Philani: Eish....this is kinda dark bro 😅
[2020/05/11, 17:45:20] Reece: Everyone letting us down
[2020/05/11, 17:45:21] Chloë: I humbly apologise 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2020/05/11, 17:45:29] Chloë: Just farming Ls dude
[2020/05/11, 17:45:31] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/11, 17:45:36] Bangie: These tutors are clueless that we need it to be in a plug-in
[2020/05/11, 17:45:50] Chloë: So..............................
[2020/05/11, 17:46:16] Chloë: Yoh but guys then what I have been spending months on 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You cannot tell me the 30 tabs I have open are for nothing
[2020/05/11, 17:46:45] Reece: We just create a program that has nothing to do with moodle?👀
[2020/05/11, 17:47:00] Reece: Good idea _*Chloe*_
[2020/05/11, 17:47:27] Reece: No but seriously it has to be a moodle plug-in
[2020/05/11, 17:47:28] Chloë: I won't lie, I will feel like an absolute doos if that is what happens, cause that is basically the only thing I have worked on
[2020/05/11, 17:47:36] Chloë: And even then it's not much
[2020/05/11, 17:47:56] Bangie: The main problem of this project was the moodle plug in 💔
[2020/05/11, 17:48:01] Chloë: So what have I even contributed then at that point
[2020/05/11, 17:48:03] Bangie: No but I get you Chloe
[2020/05/11, 17:48:28] Bangie: You put gang time into this shit , wouldn’t want that to go to waste legit
[2020/05/11, 17:48:52] Reece: We’re gonna use it Chlo Clo relax
[2020/05/11, 17:48:59] Dino: ...one job Chloe
[2020/05/11, 17:49:01] Chloë: Well the only thing that has actually been produced at this point is an *empty* plugin
[2020/05/11, 17:49:56] Reece: & a graph drawing interface
[2020/05/11, 17:50:06] Reece: & graph markers
[2020/05/11, 17:50:39] Chloë: From me I meanr
[2020/05/11, 17:50:42] Chloë: meant*

[2020/05/11, 17:55:41] Chloë: Thanks Dino
[2020/05/11, 17:57:46] Dino: I see your efforts and appreciate you 🤞🏼
[2020/05/11, 17:59:03] Chloë: Ah dude you have no idea how much I needed to hear this 😪 I gotta be honest guys I am just not coping with this whole working from home thing, everything is taking me 4 times longer than it should
[2020/05/11, 18:00:09] Reece: Dude the brief for this project is for it to be a moodle plug-in
[2020/05/11, 18:00:19] Reece: That part is 100% necessary
[2020/05/11, 18:01:08] Reece: And you’re not alone with the whole working from home thing
[2020/05/11, 18:07:01] Dino: Exactly. ✌🏼
[2020/05/11, 18:07:06] Dino: Yeah fuck I miss humans
[2020/05/11, 18:07:40] Philani: Yeah, same. It's so hard to get stuff done 😪
[2020/05/11, 18:08:31] Chloë: This ☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼

[2020/05/12, 13:45:53] Chloë: You should have gotten an email with the username, password and IP address
[2020/05/12, 13:46:16] Bangie: I have that but it just says connection reset by peer

[2020/05/12, 16:18:07] Dino: Everyone try reply ASAP so I can get back to him before he goes to Pluto again
[2020/05/12, 16:18:08] Jesse: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/05/12, 16:18:14] Jesse: I'm around
[2020/05/12, 16:18:28] Philani: Me too
[2020/05/12, 16:19:10] Reece: If he hits us with a “no I want the lecturer to set the marking criteria” imma throw my laptop at the wall
[2020/05/12, 16:19:26] Reece: Cause remember that’s what he wanted initially 😂
[2020/05/12, 16:19:40] Reece: Then Richard said we should do it this way so we just did 😂
[2020/05/12, 16:20:03] Dino: Wait what 😂😂😂 what did he mean by setting the marking criteria?
[2020/05/12, 16:20:15] Dino: I’m just gonna confirm and whoever makes it makes it
[2020/05/12, 16:20:33] Reece: Like the lecturer inputs the correct graph and we have to compare
[2020/05/12, 16:20:45] Reece: Or inputs code that marks it
[2020/05/12, 16:20:47] Reece: Or whatever
[2020/05/12, 16:20:52] Reece: Idk he was pretty vague
[2020/05/12, 16:29:44] Chloë: 😂😂😂
[2020/05/12, 16:30:17] Chloë: I'm in for tomorrow at 12

[2020/05/12, 16:57:41] Philani: Yeah
[2020/05/12, 16:58:03] Chloë: Yep
[2020/05/12, 16:58:29] Dino: Sweet. I figured he’s less likely to forget that way
[2020/05/13, 11:52:34] Dino: Just reminding you guys about the meeting soon ✌🏼

[2020/05/13, 13:01:33] Dino: So are we just gonna carry on however we think?
‎[2020/05/13, 13:01:55] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/13, 13:02:12] Reece: Word
[2020/05/13, 13:03:14] Philani: Yeah, and we talk to other groups about how they do stuff on Moodle
[2020/05/13, 13:03:38] Philani: Or Richard
[2020/05/13, 13:10:28] Dino: I back this
[2020/05/13, 21:26:21] Jesse: Can I just get a quick summary of what the lecturer needs to store for his question graph. So far I have:
Question(Actual wording)
Graph(Vertices/Edges)
Type of question(Type used to decide which marker we need to use)
Source node(for search algos)
[2020/05/13, 21:26:43] Jesse: Anything else you guys can think of?
[2020/05/13, 21:27:10] Jesse: Do we store vertex value as well?
[2020/05/13, 21:28:00] Reece: The ID
[2020/05/13, 21:28:30] Jesse: ah snap
[2020/05/13, 21:28:58] Jesse: think thats all?
[2020/05/13, 21:29:26] Jesse: I think maybe I will automate these?
[2020/05/13, 21:29:32] Reece: Nothing else I can think of
[2020/05/13, 21:29:34] Jesse: Since it's only for display purposes
[2020/05/13, 21:29:47] Reece: What do you mean
[2020/05/13, 21:30:10] Jesse: Dino uses a datamember called vertex value to display the number on the vertex
[2020/05/13, 21:30:18] Philani: I can't think of anything
[2020/05/13, 21:31:01] Reece: Isn’t that just the ‘value’ attribute of each vertex?
[2020/05/13, 21:31:56] Jesse: What does that mean tho
[2020/05/13, 21:32:23] Jesse: And would the lecturer ever need to input those
[2020/05/13, 21:32:54] Jesse: let me just store it. I can easily remove it if needed
[2020/05/14, 12:29:45] Dino: Yeah it is the value
[2020/05/14, 12:30:18] Dino: So for example if the graph problem was see the connections between kids studying maths, science, business, those would be the different values
[2020/05/17, 07:13:53] Bangie: Guys has anyone been able to connect to our server that shun provided ??
[2020/05/17, 09:09:17] Chloë: Technically yes but usefully? No
[2020/05/17, 09:10:07] Bangie: I just wanted to see if I could create our database on there rather than using my own one
[2020/05/17, 09:11:12] Bangie: Do you just ssh into it ?
[2020/05/17, 09:11:19] Chloë: Yup
[2020/05/17, 09:12:23] Bangie: This student one that’s under our group description ?
‎[2020/05/17, 09:13:23] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/17, 09:16:12] Chloë: Nay he sent one with a personal login 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
[2020/05/17, 09:16:20] Chloë: Like username csmith
[2020/05/17, 09:16:40] Bangie: Okay so who’s account are we going to use for our project ??
[2020/05/17, 09:19:42] Bangie: Also do we want to use a php database , if so we’ll need to change all our files from .html extension to .php extension so we can pass data from page to page . Problem with this is when we run the file we have to first store in like a lamp server and then run it from there all the time , so if we change some code we’ll have to change the file in the lamp server before we run it 


Or we can use firebase which is a JavaScript database 

Which one we just depends on whether it will be easier to store php files on moodle or html files on moodle
[2020/05/17, 12:06:57] Philani: Would it not be better to just use the one that doesn't require us to change much of the stuff we've done?
[2020/05/17, 12:25:26] Bangie: We can use firebase for now then
[2020/05/17, 12:33:15] Dino: Sweet ✌🏼
[2020/05/17, 12:36:40] Chloë: This would be helpful for putting it into the plugin as well, like majorly
[2020/05/17, 12:39:29] Bangie: Using php files ??
[2020/05/17, 12:39:39] Chloë: Yup
[2020/05/17, 12:40:11] Chloë: Then we don't have to mess with external libraries/moodle shit
[2020/05/17, 12:40:28] Chloë: The grunt/node.js stuff
[2020/05/17, 13:25:51] Bangie: Okay so we can do that , the only fuck up with php files is that to run them in the browser like an HTML file , you need to have the php file on lamp or whatever and when you run it you have to say http://lamp.ms.wits.ac.za/whatever.php
[2020/05/17, 13:26:24] Bangie: So like if you change a piece of code in the php file you’d have to remove the php file from lamp and then put it back into lamp and run it again
[2020/05/17, 13:31:29] Bangie: Would everyone be fine converting their files into php files but then having to run them like this 😂, because if so then I can use the php database instead of firebase
[2020/05/17, 13:48:09] Dino: Could we not setup our GitHub to be able to pull it onto the server? I’m sure that’s a thing
[2020/05/17, 13:48:46] Bangie: I’m not sure bro 🙈
[2020/05/17, 15:32:20] Chloë: Oh god
[2020/05/17, 15:33:10] Chloë: It seems like converting it should be the _last_ thing we do
‎[2020/05/17, 16:28:30] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/05/17, 16:32:56] Philani: Dude I'm still so irritated. Like I have half a mind to just ignore this.
[2020/05/17, 16:33:26] Philani: But if we do decide meet with him then I'll be free 👍🏾
[2020/05/17, 16:35:51] Chloë: Lol this actually just makes me more angry
[2020/05/17, 16:35:59] Chloë: Why would I want to waste my time again
[2020/05/17, 16:36:08] Chloë: Same
[2020/05/17, 16:36:16] Chloë: Tomorrow at 12 then
[2020/05/17, 16:36:36] Dino: I agree 100% 😂
[2020/05/17, 16:36:52] Dino: And the fact that he’s only replying now? The meeting was on Wednesday, it’s a Sunday afternoon 😂
[2020/05/17, 16:38:26] Chloë: There are how many days til the end of our *third and final* sprint?
[2020/05/17, 16:38:45] Dino: Not even sure to be honest... when is it?
[2020/05/17, 16:39:06] Chloë: 25 May
[2020/05/17, 16:39:27] Dino: Wtf... that’s next Monday
[2020/05/17, 16:40:01] Bangie: That’s for the third sprint
[2020/05/17, 16:40:20] Dino: We’re not having a fourth one though
[2020/05/17, 16:40:34] Bangie: Yeah the final one is in June I think
[2020/05/17, 16:40:45] Dino: Oh awe
[2020/05/17, 16:41:36] Chloë: I thought they were just scrapping the fourth one, having just one more retrospective and then polishing to present the final thing on the 8th of June
[2020/05/17, 16:41:50] Chloë: So it's not quite enough time for a full sprint
[2020/05/18, 10:04:49] Dino: I made another google hangouts. Please all accept it once you’ve seen it 🙏🏼
[2020/05/18, 10:27:08] Chloë: Done 😌
[2020/05/18, 10:27:38] Chloë: So the current plan for compiling the JS stuff into the plugin is using node.js, I'm at least getting somewhere with that
[2020/05/18, 10:27:56] Chloë: If that works then I won't need to convert anything to PHP files
[2020/05/18, 10:28:31] Chloë: Failing that, I made a forum post to ask for help with finding the best method, cause holy shit are the moodle docs bad
[2020/05/18, 10:29:25] Bangie: Also I realized that we don’t need to use the php database whether we convert our files to php or not so the firebase dB will work for now
[2020/05/18, 11:00:40] Chloë: That's great, hopefully we won't need to make any changes then
[2020/05/18, 11:00:59] Chloë: Do I need to be ready for a potential video call here 👀🤣
[2020/05/18, 11:04:16] Dino: Hope not 😅😂
[2020/05/18, 12:02:46] Chloë: You guys ready?
[2020/05/18, 12:04:49] Philani: Pravesh is here
[2020/05/18, 12:05:28] Chloë: Le wild Pravesh has appeared
[2020/05/18, 12:05:52] Jesse: coming
[2020/05/18, 12:23:03] Dino: Reece I can’t believe you missed the coming of Christ
[2020/05/18, 12:23:22] Dino: But niiice guys, it feels so good to know how much he loves it 😏🙏🏼
[2020/05/18, 12:24:11] Bangie: I laughed when he said I’m glad you guys chose this 😂
[2020/05/18, 12:24:34] Jesse: yeah good job guys xD
[2020/05/18, 12:24:51] Chloë: 🤣🤣🤣
[2020/05/18, 12:26:04] Dino: Same 😂😂 pretty cool that we might get to use our own software for assignments and labs in second semester 😍😂
[2020/05/18, 12:26:23] Chloë: Yeah for AAA 😌
[2020/05/18, 12:26:38] Chloë: But then if it bugs out, everyone's coming to us 😂😂
[2020/05/18, 12:27:15] Dino: Looool 😂😂 lets just add some sort of bug that checks if the student numbers are the same as one of ours, and then the graph is correct automatically
[2020/05/18, 12:27:32] Chloë: 😎
[2020/05/18, 12:31:13] Reece: Fuck guys
[2020/05/18, 12:31:53] Reece: The one meeting I miss and 😪
[2020/05/18, 12:32:37] Philani: Me too 😂
[2020/05/18, 12:32:58] Philani: Yo I didn't even think of that 😂
[2020/05/18, 12:33:10] Reece: Should’ve called me, the ringing usually wakes me up 😂
[2020/05/18, 12:34:49] Dino: Sorry bro 😂❤️
[2020/05/21, 12:42:20] Chloë: Hey guys are those diagrams done? For the database structure specifically, I need to take a look at that
[2020/05/21, 12:43:30] Philani: Yeah, I've uploaded them to Github. I asked Goolam to have a look at them when he has time but they should be correct 👍🏾
[2020/05/21, 12:43:56] Chloë: Thanks ✨
[2020/05/21, 12:49:40] Chloë: So for the class diagram, we really don't need to store anything at all for the students and lecturers, the only thing we need to store ifaik is the question/graph
[2020/05/21, 12:50:25] Philani: Yeah
[2020/05/21, 12:51:39] Chloë: And we should probably take a look at those use cases as well, the ones that are there seem good but there are a few missing, like the create question/assignment for the lecturer, probably a read question for the student as well
[2020/05/21, 12:52:35] Chloë: and then for what Pravesh was saying for the different ways a lecturer could set a question/marking criteria, so maybe a set question with built in marker, and set question with coded marker
[2020/05/21, 12:55:03] Bangie: For now though it doesn’t do the coded marker isn’t ?
[2020/05/21, 12:55:19] Chloë: not for now, that is true
[2020/05/21, 12:55:51] Chloë: but right now there isn't even a set question use case
[2020/05/21, 12:56:20] Bangie: Okay that’s my bad I’m sorry 🙈 when I made it I wasn’t sure
[2020/05/21, 12:57:19] Philani: Okay cool. I'll work on it.
[2020/05/21, 13:02:35] Chloë: No problem, this was made long before we knew what we were doing lmao 🤣
[2020/05/21, 13:03:09] Chloë: Just want to check the documentation at least cause hopefully that can be free marks
[2020/05/22, 14:42:14] Chloë: Hey guys we should probably have a meeting, either later today or tomorrow. What works for everyone?

[2020/05/22, 14:54:48] Philani: I can do tomorrow
[2020/05/22, 14:55:15] Reece: I’m good with tomorrow
[2020/05/22, 14:58:56] Dino: I’d prefer tomorrow too
[2020/05/22, 14:59:02] Dino: Thanks Chloe 🙏🏼
[2020/05/22, 21:19:49] Chloë: some wonderful person pointed me at better docs for Moodle, instead of these flowery "tutorials" that don't actually say much
[2020/05/22, 21:20:16] Chloë: so if anyone wants to take any sort of crack at it I'll be working on that this weekend, I'll post the current version on github now
[2020/05/23, 11:21:41] Philani: Can we do 2 for today?
[2020/05/23, 11:22:54] Chloë: Should be good 👍🏼
[2020/05/23, 11:23:08] Dino: Works for me ✌🏼
[2020/05/23, 11:25:58] Bangie: Same here
[2020/05/23, 14:01:34] Philani: I've started a meeting on Teams
[2020/05/23, 14:02:33] Jesse: on my way
[2020/05/23, 14:02:43] Jesse: i'll be 5 mins sorry
[2020/05/23, 14:03:21] Philani: No stress ✌🏾
[2020/05/24, 12:38:50] Chloë: So our slot is at 3 - 3:30 tomorrow, Pierce sent an invite
[2020/05/25, 10:10:58] Chloë: Good morning y'all, is there anything anyone needs me to help with before the retrospective today?
[2020/05/25, 13:16:29] Dino: ✌🏼
[2020/05/25, 13:16:44] Dino: All good on my side thanks 🙏🏼 just making some more updates to the interface
[2020/05/25, 14:37:07] Dino: Let’s have a meeting after the sprint, even just a short one?
[2020/05/25, 14:41:43] Reece: 👍🏽
[2020/05/25, 14:58:23] Jesse: where's the meeting
[2020/05/25, 14:58:26] Jesse: google meet?
[2020/05/25, 14:58:49] Dino: Yeah click the link on the email
[2020/05/25, 15:07:45] Philani: Why can't you hear me?
[2020/05/25, 15:07:57] Chloë: Not sure
[2020/05/25, 15:09:22] Philani: This is so weird. Wtf
[2020/05/25, 15:12:57] Dino: Joh guys I always laugh in these meetings 😂😂😂
[2020/05/25, 15:13:10] Bangie: No same that’s why I muted my mic 😂
[2020/05/25, 15:19:29] Philani: I was legit panicking 😂😂
[2020/05/25, 15:22:59] Dino: Reece you can talk shit hey 😉😂

[2020/05/25, 16:04:07] Chloë: Week 1 (Goolam, Reece, Jesse) - get entire program together, separate from plugin
Student and lecturer interfaces
(Goolam) sending and receiving data through the interface - currently not through the graph generator
Lecturer can select question type, create graph, will also be a text field for the written question, and an upload button to create the assignment and send it to the database.
Student input: question ID, then create graph and submit

File submission would need the student to be able to download the adjacency matrix generated by their input
Week 1 & 2 (Chloë) - put html GUI into plugin/bridge to connect separate app to Moodle plugin

(Philani) - diagrams and user stories
(wiki and acceptance criteria)
[2020/05/26, 09:53:48] Bangie: Guys I’m submitting clustering lab who wants me to put their name ?
[2020/05/26, 11:00:55] Philani: I'm good, thanks though 🙏🏾

[2020/05/26, 17:05:45] Dino: Whack
[2020/05/26, 17:06:53] Philani: Still haven't opened the FLA textbook once this entire lockdown.
‎[2020/05/27, 01:12:11] Dino: ‎video omitted
[2020/05/27, 01:12:47] Dino: Also, I think we’re gonna have to have 2 different HTML pages, one for the lecturer and one for the student. I think it will make things easier to be honest
[2020/05/27, 01:22:20] Jesse: Awesome! :DD
[2020/05/27, 01:33:42] Reece: Overtops
[2020/05/27, 01:33:47] Reece: Agreed
[2020/05/27, 07:39:23] Bangie: No for sure bro , lecturer.html and student.html
[2020/05/27, 09:58:34] Dino: I tried to put them on one but it was honestly just too painful and way too much work when the same thing can be achieved with two pages
[2020/05/27, 09:59:10] Dino: So what else do you guys need for what you’re working on?

I’ll make a rough version of the student page now, it will be the same just without the question setup thing
[2020/05/27, 10:08:34] Bangie: For the lecturer it’s perfect bro , with the student I created an initial page to just enter the ID of the question and we’ll just send that through to the student page
[2020/05/27, 10:14:50] Dino: Don’t like think it will be easier to have it on the same page? So instead of the entire question setup thing, maybe just a slot to enter the code and then a button to load the question? It will take 2 mins

[2020/05/27, 11:23:08] Jesse: do you wanna send that stuff to me then I'll add the rest of the code we need
[2020/05/27, 11:23:15] Jesse: then I'll send it on to you reece
[2020/05/27, 11:29:23] Dino: I’ve pushed it all 🙏🏼
[2020/05/27, 11:29:31] Jesse: thanks ma man
[2020/05/27, 11:30:19] Reece: 4 sho
[2020/05/28, 12:44:57] Dino: Our average for the sprints is 81%, great work guys ! 😍
[2020/05/28, 13:36:01] Chloë: 👀🙌🏼
[2020/05/28, 14:10:19] Jesse: Mooi 😄😄
[2020/06/01, 09:48:34] Bangie: Guys we meeting today ?
[2020/06/01, 10:15:26] Chloë: 🤷🏽‍♀️
[2020/06/01, 10:59:46] Jesse: 🤙
[2020/06/01, 11:18:59] Bangie: What time ?
[2020/06/01, 11:25:31] Reece: We should

[2020/06/01, 12:47:52] Dino: Chrome
[2020/06/01, 12:48:09] Dino: Do you guys rate we can specify that they should use chrome? Things go weird on edge
[2020/06/01, 12:53:57] Reece: I use Firefox and it was also wonky when I ran it
[2020/06/01, 12:54:07] Reece: Let’s stick with chrome
[2020/06/01, 12:55:10] Dino: It’s still usable but just looks shitty like this. And I know there’s a lot of these kinda things that are optimized for chrome so I don’t think it matters if we ask students to use chrome
[2020/06/01, 14:00:27] Jesse: Sorry huys
[2020/06/01, 14:00:36] Jesse: I'll be like 10mins late
[2020/06/01, 14:00:54] Chloë: Oh shit it's 2 already 🤣
[2020/06/01, 14:01:00] Chloë: Okay okay I'm on my way
[2020/06/01, 14:01:12] Reece: Same
[2020/06/01, 14:02:10] Dino: Lets start at 2:10?😂

[2020/06/02, 01:54:59] Reece: You should be so lucky
[2020/06/03, 19:59:29] Dino: What’s up guys. There’s something that I need help with please 🙏🏼 who is relatively free at the moment with regards to this project?
Basically it’s just drawing an arrow at the end of the edge if it’s directed. It’s not impossible but I think it might be quite time consuming and there’s still a bit that I need to do. It involves using trig to work out the angle between the line and the arrow and shit. Or if anyone had another idea on how to implement it that would be great 🙏🏼
[2020/06/03, 20:03:45] Jesse: Hey
[2020/06/03, 20:03:56] Jesse: Im just eating right now
[2020/06/03, 20:13:25] Bangie: Is there no line cap with an arrow ?
[2020/06/03, 20:17:21] Dino: What do you mean by line cap?🙈
[2020/06/03, 20:17:42] Dino: No rush dude ✌🏼 it’s just something that still needs to be added before we present on Monday
[2020/06/03, 20:19:58] Bangie: Like there’s caps in CGV lines
[2020/06/03, 20:20:23] Bangie: Like if you say square the ends of the line will be a square
[2020/06/03, 20:25:24] Dino: Like in graphics.strokeLine?
[2020/06/03, 20:35:57] Bangie: I think there’s like a graphics.lineCap

[2020/06/03, 21:56:50] Philani: I could have a look at it tomorrow 👍🏾
[2020/06/03, 22:28:07] Jesse: hey guys
[2020/06/03, 22:28:09] Jesse: do we have exams
[2020/06/03, 22:31:35] Chloë: Nay, science faculty is just revision and "continuous assessment"
‎[2020/06/03, 22:32:01] Chloë: ‎image omitted
[2020/06/03, 22:32:10] Chloë: So not right now, basically
[2020/06/03, 22:57:42] Reece: Could just make it one of those? And have that represent the direction
[2020/06/03, 23:05:31] Dino: The thing is that the edges line is between the center of the two vertices, but the arrow needs to be on the outside of the vertex like touching the rim
[2020/06/03, 23:14:50] Chloë: How is that implemented right now?
[2020/06/03, 23:16:11] Dino: It just draws a line from the one vertex (x,y) to the other vertex (x,y)
[2020/06/03, 23:17:03] Bangie: Maybe at the the other vertex we can like a square or something to denote an arrow
[2020/06/03, 23:18:11] Dino: I think any shape would be just as complicated to be honest. Because you have to use trig to draw it in the same direction as the edge is going
[2020/06/03, 23:18:58] Bangie: But let’s say it’s a square , it would just surround the thing
[2020/06/03, 23:19:32] Dino: You mean draw a square that would surround the whole vertex?
‎[2020/06/03, 23:19:55] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/06/03, 23:27:22] Chloë: Maybe just draw the line to the 2nd point, minus the radius of your vertex? Though modeling and drawing the arrow in the right direction seems hectic
[2020/06/03, 23:27:51] Chloë: So does it just draw a path from (x, y) to (x, y)?
[2020/06/03, 23:28:09] Dino: Yeah ✌🏼

[2020/06/03, 23:30:48] Chloë: Oh wait are you trying to draw the triangle itself as well? Cause maybe you could try just modeling the triangle on its own, rotating in the direction of the line and then drawing it
[2020/06/03, 23:31:35] Dino: Eish hey 😅😅
[2020/06/03, 23:32:20] Chloë: Yeah no that seems so tedious and annoying 🤣 one would think they'd have arrows for things like this
[2020/06/03, 23:49:01] Bangie: Maybe we could draw the line with the arrow and rotate them as a whole
[2020/06/03, 23:50:48] Dino: The line isn’t getting rotated though, it’s just getting redrawn as the mouse is dragged 😔
[2020/06/03, 23:52:40] Bangie: Ohh Fuck
[2020/06/03, 23:53:14] Bangie: Is there a way we could draw a block at the end of the line
[2020/06/03, 23:54:41] Reece: We can draw a triangle at the midpoint of the line
[2020/06/03, 23:54:57] Reece: And use trig to find the angle to rotate it by
[2020/06/03, 23:55:33] Reece: I’ll give it a shot tomorrow
[2020/06/04, 00:43:10] Dino: Awe 🙏🏼
[2020/06/04, 13:26:06] Bangie: 50% of our mark is project 
50% is end of year exam
[2020/06/04, 13:46:21] Dino: Yoh those end of years exams are gonna chow us guys 😂😂
[2020/06/04, 14:02:26] Bangie: If there is even an end of year exams 😂
[2020/06/04, 14:02:54] Bangie: They’ll have to give us a considerable amount of time to study for 8 subjects
[2020/06/04, 14:05:43] Dino: They better 😕
[2020/06/04, 14:25:46] Reece: The end of this year finna hit us like a truck
[2020/06/04, 14:26:21] Reece: Oath I’m only gonna open that FLA book for the first time in October 😂
[2020/06/04, 14:31:56] Dino: 100% 😂😂

[2020/06/04, 20:17:23] Bangie: Dijkstra should also have weights isn’t ??
I guess the weights wouldn’t have an impact in Coloring , DFS and BFS , but I might be wrong 
Directed could apply to all of them I think
[2020/06/04, 20:47:56] Dino: I think that sounds pretty solid 🙏🏼
[2020/06/04, 23:23:02] Dino: Yoh guys I have some sick updates to show you tomorrow 🔥
[2020/06/04, 23:31:36] Dino: Also would anybody be able to please setup some test questions that we can use to test if it works 🙈 
I haven’t set up the student side yet. But just use the lecturer side to create and set up a “bfstest”, “dfstest”, etc for the 5 different questions (by that I mean use that as the actual question codes just for ease of access purposes). Then when I’ve set up the student side we can use those to check if everything is working fine ✌🏼
[2020/06/04, 23:33:34] Chloë: Could probably just use past tut questions
[2020/06/04, 23:44:44] Chloë: If we're set on using the standalone app, I should at least do this
[2020/06/05, 09:36:10] Dino: Good idea
[2020/06/05, 09:36:20] Dino: You guys all okay with 1pm?
[2020/06/05, 09:36:28] Bangie: I’m fine with it bro

[2020/06/05, 18:08:04] Jesse: Do we want to be calling a method on the graph class to see if its weighted/directed, or have global booleans stored in the html file
[2020/06/05, 18:27:04] Reece: First one
[2020/06/05, 18:27:19] Reece: Then call that to store the Boolean in the html file
[2020/06/05, 18:29:57] Jesse: If im calling it from the graph class do you mind if i just derive the booleans from the adjacency matrix rather, itll be like 5 lines of code
[2020/06/05, 18:30:33] Chloë: PSA for the ML quiz due tomorrow morning
[2020/06/05, 18:30:47] Jesse: Psa?

[2020/06/12, 12:16:44] Dino: Please help me out 🙏🏼 
Will there be a case where the student will have to enter edges that the lecturer didn’t? Or will they only have to add and remove predefined edges that the lecturer has already added
[2020/06/12, 12:17:18] Reece: Second one
[2020/06/12, 12:17:54] Reece: They can’t add a vertex or edge that doesn’t already exist in the graph
[2020/06/12, 13:29:13] Philani: I can meet
[2020/06/12, 13:40:55] Chloë: We're having our CGV meeting now but then I'm sure we'll be around, I'll just be a minute or two, need to set up somewhere else

[2020/06/12, 13:54:53] Reece: Guys
[2020/06/12, 13:54:59] Reece: Are we having this meeting
[2020/06/12, 13:55:27] Dino: Well you haven’t exactly replied 😴
[2020/06/12, 13:55:33] Dino: Should we meet at 2:30?
[2020/06/12, 13:56:00] Reece: Could we do now?
[2020/06/12, 13:56:03] Bangie: Can I come a bit late , I have to hit a drive to fetch shit from my old house 🙈
[2020/06/12, 13:56:29] Dino: What time will you be free?
[2020/06/12, 13:57:19] Bangie: 3:30?
[2020/06/12, 13:57:26] Dino: I’m cool with that ✌🏼
[2020/06/12, 13:58:43] Reece: Alright I can’t make today then
[2020/06/12, 13:58:44] Chloë: 👍🏼
[2020/06/12, 13:59:06] Reece: Let me know what’s happening
[2020/06/12, 13:59:07] Jesse: you're out of the team
[2020/06/12, 13:59:40] Reece: Fuck
[2020/06/12, 14:01:11] Philani: I can do that time. But, I might not be able to stay the whole time cause my group is gonna present for CGV later.
[2020/06/12, 14:01:34] Dino: Should we rather meet tomorrow?
[2020/06/12, 14:01:49] Chloë: That's fine
[2020/06/12, 14:01:55] Reece: I was gonna say
[2020/06/12, 14:02:00] Jesse: okeh
[2020/06/12, 14:02:01] Reece: 12?
[2020/06/12, 14:02:09] Chloë: Is there anything I can do in the mean time? like cleaning up documentation or whatever
[2020/06/12, 14:02:34] Jesse: okeh
[2020/06/12, 14:02:38] Dino: Has anyone done the testing questions?🙈 I’m basically done with the interface, just a few bugs
[2020/06/12, 14:03:49] Jesse: Just swing it my way when you finish dino 🤙
[2020/06/12, 14:03:51] Chloë: Shit yes then that's the thing 🤣
[2020/06/12, 14:04:11] Dino: What do you still need to do?✌🏼
[2020/06/12, 14:04:34] Jesse: Just implement my code on your version
[2020/06/12, 14:05:07] Dino: Just the stuff to check if the code already exists?
[2020/06/12, 14:05:44] Jesse: and also pre-populating the drop list with edges they can use
[2020/06/12, 14:06:56] Dino: Dude.... I didn’t know you were still gonna work on it, so I’ve spent the whole of last night and today doing it 🙃
[2020/06/12, 14:07:18] Jesse: oh hectic 😂
[2020/06/12, 14:07:26] Jesse: sorry dude
[2020/06/12, 14:07:56] Jesse: then yeah, just this
[2020/06/12, 14:08:01] Reece: We should’ve done our daily scrums 😂
[2020/06/12, 14:08:37] Jesse: 😂
[2020/06/12, 14:08:41] Philani: Eish 😅
[2020/06/12, 20:02:20] Philani: Can we please rather do 11 tomorrow 🙏🏾
[2020/06/12, 20:12:14] Dino: Cool with me ✌🏼
[2020/06/12, 21:12:05] Reece: 4sho
[2020/06/13, 11:01:06] Philani: We still meeting?
[2020/06/13, 11:01:48] Dino: Yeah ✌🏼
[2020/06/13, 11:02:01] Philani: Sick
[2020/06/13, 11:39:35] Chloë: Oh shit lol are you guys still meeting
[2020/06/13, 11:39:42] Chloë: I didn't see the change to 11
[2020/06/13, 11:43:09] Reece: Nah
[2020/06/13, 11:43:15] Reece: All good chlo chlo
[2020/06/13, 11:43:29] Reece: Just speak to Philani
[2020/06/13, 11:43:34] Chloë: Okay will do
[2020/06/13, 23:08:59] Chloë: I still can't access taiga, not even through the links in those update emails :(
[2020/06/13, 23:09:50] Chloë: so afaik, I just need to do some minutes just summarising the contents of our meetings? Like a typed out version of that set of notes we made for the single IRL meeting we had
[2020/06/15, 12:24:36] Reece: Group meeting on teams at 1:30 so everyone’s up to date for the presentation 🤙🏾
[2020/06/15, 12:25:00] Chloë: 👍🏼✨
[2020/06/15, 12:25:18] Dino: Sick
[2020/06/15, 12:27:27] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/06/15, 12:29:56] Jesse: will fix the error with coverage xP dont worry about the email if you get one
[2020/06/15, 14:01:19] Philani: Guys it's not letting me in. Wtf 😂
[2020/06/15, 14:02:14] Reece: Make sure you’re on your student account
[2020/06/15, 14:02:18] Reece: Not your personal
[2020/06/15, 14:02:29] Philani: The audio doesn't work on my student
[2020/06/15, 14:02:56] Philani: Never mind 😂
[2020/06/15, 14:24:47] Dino: “So is that your project?”,  that hurt 💔💔💔
[2020/07/06, 20:10:12] Chloë: There's a way for us to have a sort of live site of our project hosted on github pages if you guys want to try that
[2020/07/07, 21:58:17] Dino: Sounds good
[2020/07/13, 11:35:26] Dino: We could also host it on LAMP, and run it the same way we did for the CGV projects
[2020/07/13, 11:44:31] Bangie: Yeah I think that’s why they gave us our own server
[2020/07/13, 11:45:28] Dino: But also we have a whole semester to figure shit out, so Chloe I’m still certain that your work won’t go to waste 🙏🏼
[2020/07/13, 11:45:38] Dino: Should we maybe have a meeting tomorrow during the lab session?
[2020/07/13, 13:41:18] Chloë: Yeah we have 4-ish weeks til the first sprint retrospective for this semester, so a meeting could be a good idea
[2020/07/13, 23:14:01] Philani: Sounds good ✌🏾
[2020/07/14, 12:25:01] Dino: Maybe we can meet at like 3?
[2020/07/14, 12:31:22] Bangie: I’m down ⚡️
[2020/07/14, 13:26:43] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/07/14, 13:36:54] Chloë: Anyone know what's klapping with the intro lab today?
[2020/07/14, 13:39:32] Bangie: Just for consultations with tutors
[2020/07/14, 13:39:59] Chloë: So we don't have to show up at all right? 😬😂
[2020/07/14, 13:45:56] Bangie: I don’t think so , does anyone have questions for Pierce ?
[2020/07/14, 13:46:10] Chloë: Not at this time
[2020/07/14, 14:26:56] Dino: Jesse and Reece haven’t read this so there’s no point having the meeting 😂
[2020/07/14, 14:30:09] Chloë: Eh we have 4 weeks til the next retrospective, let's just meet sometime in the next week and in the meantime get back into it, with whatever everyone was/is busy with
[2020/07/14, 14:37:27] Philani: Wow 😂
[2020/07/14, 14:37:41] Philani: Sounds like a plan ✌🏾
[2020/07/14, 14:37:58] Dino: Awe that’s chilled ✌🏼
[2020/07/14, 14:38:38] Bangie: Are we gonna do our own thing like last semester , because I don’t know if Pravesh will be easier to contact
[2020/07/14, 14:39:05] Dino: I’ll email him now and try plan a meeting
[2020/07/14, 14:39:11] Bangie: I heard his wife gave birth so the man might be more MIA
[2020/07/14, 14:41:11] Philani: Oh wow. Congrats to them. But eish yeah he'll probably be even more difficult to get a hold of 😅
[2020/07/14, 14:43:13] Reece: No worries bro I saw the message
[2020/07/14, 14:43:43] Reece: ^
[2020/07/14, 14:44:35] Reece: But I now see that the meeting has been postponed 😂
[2020/07/14, 14:45:54] Reece: Oh fuck, and isn’t he taking us for  AAA as well? Looks like we’re on our own for half of this semester’s modules 🙃😂
[2020/07/14, 14:48:41] Chloë: UwU that's sweet
[2020/07/14, 14:49:16] Chloë: Eish dude 🤣 he did say he'd need our project for this thing to even work this semester 👀😳
[2020/07/14, 14:51:57] Dino: Oh hectic
[2020/07/14, 14:52:04] Chloë: And I have load shedding in like an hour sooooo 😑 things are just going so well
[2020/07/14, 14:52:19] Dino: That’s rough 😂😂
‎[2020/07/14, 15:00:51] Chloë: OPERATING_SYSTEMS_THREE_EASY_PIECES.pdf ‎document omitted
[2020/07/14, 15:01:15] Chloë: Textbook for OS, you guys need to read the dialogue before the content starts 🤣🤣🤣
[2020/07/14, 15:05:15] Dino: Wowwww 😂😂😂 why does it feel like something that should be in a grade 8 textbook, not 3rd year 😂
[2020/07/14, 15:05:40] Chloë: I know what you mean 🤣
‎[2020/07/14, 15:07:59] Dino: ‎image omitted

[2020/07/14, 15:09:36] Chloë: Yee haw
[2020/07/14, 17:54:17] Philani: Thank you
[2020/07/14, 19:23:11] Jesse: Hey guys
[2020/07/14, 19:23:12] Jesse: Sorry wasn't around 😖
‎[2020/07/14, 19:35:26] Chloë: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/14, 21:13:54] Bangie: Any idea of how tomorrow’s lecture will be conducted
[2020/07/14, 21:34:40] Reece: Wut
[2020/07/14, 21:35:42] Bangie: Like is it a live zoom thing or just notes posted
[2020/07/14, 21:36:44] Reece: If we’re gonna start having live meetings with attendance I’m dropping out
[2020/07/14, 21:36:57] Bangie: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/07/14, 22:08:45] Dino: Surely they would’ve let us know if we were having a lecture
[2020/07/14, 23:31:32] Jesse: Yoh
[2020/07/14, 23:31:33] Jesse: Facts
[2020/07/14, 23:31:39] Dino: I feel this 😂
[2020/07/15, 00:42:39] Chloë: There appears to be a dialogue for every section
[2020/07/15, 11:13:21] Jesse: Any labs today?
[2020/07/15, 11:47:22] Dino: Oh wow 😂
[2020/07/15, 11:47:26] Dino: Negative
[2020/07/15, 11:59:59] Jesse: 🙏🙂
[2020/07/18, 15:34:20] Jesse: we gonna start up soon? 😝
[2020/07/18, 15:35:20] Dino: Let’s have a meeting on Monday?🙏🏼
[2020/07/18, 15:35:27] Jesse: cool
[2020/07/18, 15:35:52] Jesse: Im busy from 13:00 till about 15:00
[2020/07/18, 15:36:02] Jesse: and then maybe from 16:30 till late
[2020/07/18, 15:40:37] Dino: We could do 11am if everyone is cool with that?😇
[2020/07/18, 15:41:18] Reece: Neg
[2020/07/18, 15:41:27] Reece: 15:00 then?
[2020/07/18, 15:41:37] Jesse: k
[2020/07/18, 15:41:40] Jesse: thats fine
[2020/07/18, 15:57:07] Chloë: 👌🏼
[2020/07/19, 11:41:27] Dino: Sweet ✌🏼
[2020/07/19, 22:55:31] Chloë: Guyssssssss Pravesh isn't taking us for AAA anymore
[2020/07/19, 22:55:35] Chloë: There was an email
[2020/07/19, 22:59:33] Dino: I saw, that’s so sad :((
[2020/07/19, 23:03:19] Reece: Dawg I’m crine
[2020/07/19, 23:03:50] Reece: But to be fair if Pravesh was taking us we’d be taking ourselves
[2020/07/19, 23:04:20] Reece: Who knows maybe Lime Shang turns out to be the best lecturer we’ve ever had
[2020/07/19, 23:04:22] Dino: That’s true 😂😂
[2020/07/19, 23:18:04] Dino: I back it
[2020/07/19, 23:18:23] Dino: I’m pretty keen for this semesters subjects 😏 and I think the rest of the project is gonna be dope to work on
[2020/07/19, 23:39:09] Chloë: First lecture at 14:15 tomorrow
[2020/07/19, 23:40:04] Chloë: Me toooooo
[2020/07/19, 23:41:58] Reece: Same, but tbh (and I know it’s ironic because I end up skipping lectures after the first few anyway) ... the fact that we’re not gonna have any lectures (irl) has got me far less excited
[2020/07/19, 23:43:21] Reece: It feels like I dropped out of university and I’m just taking some online classes to pass time
[2020/07/20, 00:26:38] Chloë: Same, and it's not even fun cause it's a thing I *have* to do
[2020/07/20, 00:26:53] Chloë: Might as well have just taken a gap year and tried again in 2021
[2020/07/20, 00:32:22] Dino: Yeah I feel that dude 🙄 like think about how dope Richards lectures were, and like Praveshes last year
[2020/07/20, 00:33:36] Chloë: His online lectures were still pretty great 🤣 I enjoyed them at least. Idk what it was about that venue in OGS but I couldn't stay awake
[2020/07/20, 10:49:55] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/07/20, 10:55:53] Reece: Guys I don’t have power, my phone is on 6% and my laptop is dead 🙃😂
[2020/07/20, 10:57:44] Reece: Not sure when it’s coming back but if it doesn’t before 3 I won’t be able to make the meeting (and I wouldn’t be able to tell you)
[2020/07/20, 10:58:18] Reece: Can we have it tomorrow?
[2020/07/20, 11:02:00] Reece: Scratch that it’s back see you guys at 3 😂
[2020/07/20, 11:32:53] Bangie: Don’t we have a lecture at 14:15 today ?
[2020/07/20, 11:55:59] Chloë: Allegedly
[2020/07/20, 11:56:13] Chloë: For AAA, there's a moodle course and we got an email
[2020/07/20, 12:15:34] Dino: Do you rate it will be live though?
[2020/07/20, 12:16:00] Dino: If we have a lecture, then we won’t have the meeting. If we don’t have a lecture, see you guys at 3?🙏🏼
[2020/07/20, 12:27:54] Philani: I doubt it. I feel like he's just gonna post the lecture that should've been posted last Wednesday, and then we might get another one on Wednesday again.
[2020/07/20, 12:28:02] Philani: Cool ✌🏾
[2020/07/20, 12:30:42] Philani: Cause isn't today meant to be an OS lab?
[2020/07/20, 12:32:11] Dino: Agreed 😂
[2020/07/20, 12:32:23] Chloë: 👍🏼
[2020/07/20, 14:39:14] Chloë: By "lecture will start at 14:15" they meant "we'll post some shit sometime after 14:15"
[2020/07/20, 14:46:07] Reece: Guys my power went out again about an hour ago and still hasn’t come back
[2020/07/20, 14:46:23] Reece: So I am once again making this request
[2020/07/20, 14:47:06] Chloë: That's fine by me 🤣 I'm free any time basically
[2020/07/20, 14:48:01] Bangie: Did anyone watch the video 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:48:16] Chloë: Not yet, was gonna watch it after the meeting
[2020/07/20, 14:48:26] Chloë: Is it weird? 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:48:30] Bangie: Wow 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:48:39] Bangie: It’s a 25 min video on linear search
[2020/07/20, 14:49:11] Dino: Waste of time 🙄
[2020/07/20, 14:49:13] Reece: So what you’re saying is, don’t bother ?
[2020/07/20, 14:49:48] Jesse: 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:49:51] Jesse: Haibi
[2020/07/20, 14:49:53] Jesse: Haibo
[2020/07/20, 14:50:27] Chloë: Well that's bold
[2020/07/20, 14:52:09] Reece: It’s like I’m talking to myself
[2020/07/20, 14:52:29] Chloë: Hey I responded 😠
[2020/07/20, 14:52:41] Jesse: So what do you guys think of the courses for the rest of the year
[2020/07/20, 14:52:56] Chloë: 🤣
[2020/07/20, 14:52:57] Reece: 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:53:17] Jesse: Tomorrow works for me 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:53:27] Dino: Taste of your own medicine
[2020/07/20, 14:53:54] Dino: But awe 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:54:08] Reece: Fair enough 😂
[2020/07/20, 14:54:16] Dino: Tomorrow is chilled with me, only thing is that we have a lab so we’ll have to do it before
[2020/07/20, 14:54:24] Jesse: Oh hectic
[2020/07/20, 14:54:26] Reece: Did you guys check your ML marks on Self service
[2020/07/20, 14:54:26] Philani: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/07/20, 14:54:54] Dino: Eish 😂😂
[2020/07/20, 14:55:02] Philani: Yeah, can we do it before the lab.
[2020/07/20, 14:55:04] Philani: ?*
[2020/07/20, 14:55:17] Philani: Like 12 or something
[2020/07/20, 14:55:18] Dino: Nah, what does the mark even mean though? Like it’s not our final mark obviously because of the exam right?
[2020/07/20, 14:55:44] Philani: I think it's just the assignment and the quizzes. So like continuous assessment mark
[2020/07/20, 14:55:50] Dino: Oh awe
[2020/07/20, 14:55:58] Reece: My guess is it’s everything excluding the exam
[2020/07/20, 14:55:59] Philani: And like exam will be like 50%
[2020/07/20, 14:56:23] Reece: So divide it by two to get your actual mark so far (assuming the exam is 50%)
[2020/07/20, 14:56:35] Philani: Yeah
[2020/07/20, 14:58:00] Jesse: Richard said he has almost convinced everyone to allow us not to write a cgv exam
[2020/07/20, 14:59:07] Reece: Praise the sun
[2020/07/20, 14:59:18] Reece: There’s so much fucking threory for CGV
[2020/07/20, 14:59:28] Reece: Theory*
[2020/07/20, 14:59:42] Philani: Oh damn. Where did you hear that?
[2020/07/20, 15:01:11] Bangie: Ohh how I pray this is true 😂 CGV theory is like studying poetry and literature in school
[2020/07/20, 15:01:46] Jesse: Fuck😂
[2020/07/20, 15:01:56] Jesse: Had a call with him
[2020/07/20, 15:02:20] Dino: The legend is back. I will be so happy wow
[2020/07/20, 15:15:04] Philani: Oh okay. Fingers crossed that's the reality 😂🤞🏾
[2020/07/20, 15:25:52] Chloë: Oh are the assignment marks out then?
[2020/07/20, 15:28:02] Chloë: The man is such a lad
[2020/07/20, 15:33:00] Bangie: Jesse convince him bro
[2020/07/20, 15:34:12] Jesse: He was sort of convincing me tbh xD
[2020/07/20, 15:34:37] Chloë: Do you think he also just really doesn't want to set and mark a paper? 🤣
[2020/07/20, 15:46:37] Reece: I back it 😂
[2020/07/20, 21:32:24] Dino: seems fair 😂😂
[2020/07/20, 21:32:33] Dino: CGV marks are also on self service now

[2020/07/22, 15:14:46] Reece: What platform?
[2020/07/22, 15:17:02] Dino: I asked him if we’re still on for today and he didn’t reply lol
[2020/07/22, 15:17:14] Dino: But if he does, I’ll set up a google meet and invite you guys
[2020/07/22, 15:17:27] Chloë: Lmao

[2020/07/22, 16:00:02] Dino: Same 😅😂
[2020/07/22, 16:00:22] Dino: Just stay on your phones because he might reply in the next 5 mins

[2020/07/22, 16:08:27] Jesse: meeting with richard?
[2020/07/22, 16:08:47] Bangie: Guys look we tried we should just do our own shit
[2020/07/22, 16:09:13] Philani: Yeah, I agree.
[2020/07/22, 16:10:47] Dino: I’ll ask him for tomorrow
[2020/07/22, 16:11:00] Jesse: cool
[2020/07/22, 16:11:02] Jesse: :)
[2020/07/22, 16:11:13] Dino: Yeah this is bullshit now. Maybe Richard will be able to help us out
[2020/07/22, 16:12:34] Dino: Wait he said he can meet now lol

[2020/07/22, 16:22:39] Bangie: Sorry I didn’t know we were gonna meet so I went to the shop quickly
[2020/07/22, 16:23:16] Philani: No stress
[2020/07/22, 16:37:54] Chloë: Download text file for submission
Fix arrows

Deployment is goal for sprint 1, this *requires* the file download function
Meeting about first lab to come
[2020/07/22, 16:38:32] Philani: Sorry guys my computer keeps fking out
[2020/07/22, 16:38:36] Philani: I'm not being rude
[2020/07/22, 16:38:55] Chloë: No stress
[2020/07/22, 16:39:55] Chloë: Need to return Java objects, rather than JavaScript
[2020/07/22, 16:40:54] Chloë: Comedic timing dies to choppy internet, hade Reece
[2020/07/22, 16:42:47] Chloë: Deployment in 2 weeks for graph colouring lab
[2020/07/22, 16:47:30] Chloë: I'll add these meeting notes to the wiki
[2020/07/22, 16:48:47] Philani: Thanks 🙏🏾
[2020/07/22, 16:49:06] Philani: I added the stuff for the previous sprint planning meeting earlier today.
[2020/07/22, 16:50:54] Dino: I’m super proud of us guys⚡️
‎[2020/07/22, 16:52:39] Bangie: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/22, 16:53:21] Dino: Sick 🙏🏼
[2020/07/22, 16:56:28] Chloë: There's someone called James Cloos following our repo?
[2020/07/22, 16:56:54] Dino: This bitch is gonna steak our program
[2020/07/22, 17:04:51] Reece: Dawg
[2020/07/22, 17:04:53] Reece: Block him
[2020/07/22, 17:04:57] Reece: Can we do that
[2020/07/22, 17:05:07] Reece: Wait
[2020/07/22, 17:05:11] Reece: Can’t we make it private
[2020/07/22, 17:05:13] Dino: Our repo is public so I don’t know but I’ll check
‎[2020/07/22, 17:06:02] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/22, 17:06:10] Dino: I think you can only have like 3 people then
[2020/07/22, 17:06:25] Jesse: Awesome. Instead of using .stringify tho we needa use our current method which converts it to a string
[2020/07/22, 17:06:47] Jesse: Fuck james
[2020/07/22, 17:09:37] Bangie: Yeah but the main part is the file thing
[2020/07/22, 17:10:20] Dino: I’m happy to do that part because I’ll also add the button to the interface so it will be easy ✌🏼
[2020/07/22, 17:10:44] Bangie: I’m gonna look into the arrow thing
[2020/07/22, 17:11:08] Dino: Don’t worry about that for this sprint
[2020/07/22, 17:11:48] Chloë: Eish guys I have no idea how we're going to come up with 20 more user stories to do this semester 🤣
[2020/07/22, 17:12:09] Dino: We’ll break them all down so much 😂😂
[2020/07/22, 17:12:49] Jesse: Task 1: Write let
Task 2: Write varName
[2020/07/22, 17:12:58] Jesse: Task 3: Write =
[2020/07/22, 17:13:09] Dino: 100% 😂😂
[2020/07/22, 17:25:53] Bangie: Pray we get a new tutor
[2020/07/22, 17:26:24] Bangie: Deployment onto lamp server just needs that scp command
[2020/07/22, 17:35:24] Philani: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/07/22, 17:39:22] Dino: Yeah it’s super easy, but pravesh said he doesn’t want it on lamp so we’ll have to see what he says
[2020/07/22, 17:41:23] Dino: https://calendly.com/kleinric/sdp

Everyone tell me what time on Friday suits you
[2020/07/22, 17:49:48] Bangie: Anytime Before 2 is fine for me
[2020/07/22, 17:50:05] Reece: Let’s do 12
[2020/07/22, 17:51:04] Chloë: I don't know when I got to the point that 12 is "too early in the morning" for me
[2020/07/22, 17:51:42] Chloë: But I'll be there 😂
[2020/07/22, 17:52:18] Reece: Welcome to my world
[2020/07/22, 17:52:34] Reece: But the latest time is 12:30
[2020/07/22, 17:53:23] Dino: Awe I’ll book for 12
[2020/07/22, 17:54:05] Dino: I’ll actually do 12:30 so there’s nobody after us
[2020/07/22, 17:55:25] Reece: Smart move
[2020/07/22, 17:58:53] Dino: I forwarded the confirmation to you guys
[2020/07/22, 18:09:57] Philani: Thanks
[2020/07/22, 18:11:16] Chloë: 👍🏼
[2020/07/23, 08:37:38] Bangie: Guys has anyone tried to watch the parallel computing lectures
[2020/07/23, 08:37:56] Chloë: Yes... nearly shot myself
[2020/07/23, 08:38:25] Bangie: Did you listen for the 10 mins and then leave?
[2020/07/23, 08:38:50] Chloë: Nah I stuck through it, watched it with my sister to have a kek
[2020/07/23, 08:39:21] Chloë: It seems like she was doing some sort of stream and recorded that, posted with no editing
[2020/07/23, 08:39:32] Bangie: 😂😂😂
[2020/07/23, 08:39:49] Chloë: Seriously made me want to commit sudoku
[2020/07/23, 10:30:29] Dino: Sudoku 😂😂😂
[2020/07/23, 10:55:26] Chloë: I stole that one from Matthew, I must admit
[2020/07/24, 11:58:37] Dino: Guys do we know what we want to ask Richard 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:02:32] Reece: I was thinking the same 🤔😂
[2020/07/24, 12:03:01] Chloë: Lmaooooooo
[2020/07/24, 12:03:02] Philani: I think the big thing is finding out if it would worth it to integrate the marker to moodle 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
[2020/07/24, 12:03:23] Philani: I could be wrong though 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:03:29] Chloë: But also tell him that Pravesh said not really 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
[2020/07/24, 12:03:46] Philani: Yeah true 😂😅
[2020/07/24, 12:03:47] Reece: So for rn it’s deployment and importing/exporting text files
[2020/07/24, 12:03:55] Chloë: Yee
[2020/07/24, 12:04:29] Reece: I don’t know about deployment but I don’t see us needing any assistance for the rest
[2020/07/24, 12:04:52] Reece: And we’ve already scrapped this ... Pravesh even suggested it
[2020/07/24, 12:05:41] Dino: We’ll just wing it
[2020/07/24, 12:05:46] Reece: Nah bro
[2020/07/24, 12:05:54] Reece: I don’t wanna waste the guys time
[2020/07/24, 12:06:01] Philani: Same
[2020/07/24, 12:06:07] Dino: Yeah true
[2020/07/24, 12:06:23] Dino: Should I ask him about the quiz with the 4 attempts thingy?
[2020/07/24, 12:06:36] Reece: I assumed one of you had something specific that you wanted to speak about
[2020/07/24, 12:06:44] Reece: But clearly not
[2020/07/24, 12:06:55] Reece: But we’ve already made the booking 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:07:10] Philani: This is what I meant about integrate it with moodle. Like with sending marks and stuff to Moodle.
[2020/07/24, 12:07:17] Dino: I feel like we did, until pravesh said moodle can kinda get scrapped 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:07:29] Dino: Oh okay awe
[2020/07/24, 12:07:33] Reece: We don’t have to worry about that shit though
[2020/07/24, 12:07:57] Reece: Pravesh said they handle things on the marker side
[2020/07/24, 12:08:21] Reece: We just have to give them the means to deal with this stuff once it’s been submitted
[2020/07/24, 12:08:36] Reece: So essentially we don’t really have to touch moodle
[2020/07/24, 12:08:54] Dino: Well let’s also show him our interface and get his opinion on it, he’ll probably have some good input
[2020/07/24, 12:09:00] Reece: Yeah
[2020/07/24, 12:09:42] Reece: And we can ask about the moodle stuff too cause I don’t think we really know what’s klapping but if we do we’ll know exactly what we need to do
‎[2020/07/24, 12:09:53] Dino: ‎audio omitted
[2020/07/24, 12:10:30] Reece: And if the meeting does end up a bust we can just tell him we scheduled the meeting before we meet with pravesh so he already answered some of the questions we “would’ve” asked Richard 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:11:00] Philani: Yeah we could definitely ask about Marker2 cause I have no idea what that is 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:11:19] Dino: Yeah exactly, I don’t think we’ll be wasting his time because there are still many questions we can ask him, I’m sure he doesn’t mind helping out where he can
[2020/07/24, 12:11:28] Reece: Okay awe
[2020/07/24, 12:11:35] Reece: At least we have some direction now 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:11:41] Philani: True 😂
[2020/07/24, 12:11:57] Dino: Awe this will be solid 😂🙏🏼
[2020/07/24, 12:12:04] Reece: Yeah plus I also kinda wanna see if he thinks it’s cool too
[2020/07/24, 12:12:11] Dino: For sure
[2020/07/24, 12:13:05] Philani: So basically then it's just:

Showing him our thing and telling him that it was meant to be a moodle marker and get his input on that.

Tell him we wanted to deploy on LAMP, but then Pravesh suggested Marker2
[2020/07/24, 12:14:14] Reece: In a 🌰
[2020/07/24, 12:14:23] Dino: 😂😂
[2020/07/24, 12:14:26] Reece: Wait is that a nut
[2020/07/24, 12:14:33] Dino: Sounds good ✌🏼
[2020/07/24, 12:14:39] Philani: Okay sick
[2020/07/24, 12:14:41] Dino: I think so 😂

[2020/07/24, 13:02:44] Reece: Goolam & Jesse, you guys good to meet at 1 tomorrow?
[2020/07/24, 13:11:44] Bangie: Sorry guys I had to go to the doctor I fucked up my back this morning
[2020/07/24, 13:12:16] Philani: Are you okay?
[2020/07/24, 13:16:41] Reece: Goolam
[2020/07/24, 13:16:44] Reece: Who hurt you
[2020/07/24, 13:16:47] Reece: Where do they live
[2020/07/24, 13:16:54] Dino: Sorry to hear dude 🥺
[2020/07/24, 13:19:02] Bangie: No I was building this gazebo thing with my dad and the roof part fell on my back
[2020/07/24, 13:19:24] Reece: So it was a faulty gazebo?
[2020/07/24, 13:19:29] Reece: Who sold it to you
[2020/07/24, 13:19:44] Chloë: Reece'll fuck em up for you
[2020/07/24, 13:19:47] Bangie: Nahh we had to assemble it from scratch
[2020/07/24, 13:19:51] Chloë: We'll hype in the background
[2020/07/24, 13:29:39] Philani: Sorry I hear that Goolam. Hope you're not in too much pain 🙏🏾
‎[2020/07/25, 00:09:11] Chloë: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/25, 00:09:42] Reece: @ Pravesh
[2020/07/25, 09:53:00] Dino: That’s so accurate 😂😂
[2020/07/25, 10:57:14] Dino: Are we still gonna meet today?
[2020/07/25, 11:20:55] Reece: Can anyone get a hold of Jesso?
[2020/07/25, 11:21:49] Bangie: What time guys ?
[2020/07/25, 11:23:27] Philani: 😂😂😂
[2020/07/25, 11:23:37] Philani: We initially planned for 1
[2020/07/25, 11:24:13] Reece: But it seems like Jesse is MIA so maybe we postpone
[2020/07/25, 11:24:43] Bangie: We can do later today?
[2020/07/25, 11:24:57] Chloë: Later today/whenever a wild Jesse appears
[2020/07/25, 11:25:09] Dino: 😂
[2020/07/25, 11:25:43] Bangie: What time later today guys ? If we do today 😂
[2020/07/25, 11:25:47] Dino: I feel like we could just have it and tell Jesse what it needs to do because we don’t know when this guy will come back
[2020/07/25, 11:26:06] Bangie: Because my cousin is writing her NBT paper and she wants me to help her with the math part
[2020/07/25, 11:26:57] Reece: Fair enough, just thought he might have also wanted to give some input
[2020/07/25, 11:27:07] Reece: So let’s stick to 1 then?
[2020/07/25, 11:27:37] Philani: I'm chilled with that.
[2020/07/25, 11:27:43] Dino: Because we’re also gonna have the meeting with Richard at 4 on Monday so we could all meet earlier and have another meeting. Or we could just do it then. To be fair I’m not gonna do any work now so there’s no rush on my side
[2020/07/25, 11:28:24] Bangie: I’d prefer Monday but if everyone wants today then I’ll make a plan ⚡️
[2020/07/25, 11:28:26] Reece: lol same tbh 😂
[2020/07/25, 11:28:39] Reece: To this
[2020/07/25, 11:28:49] Reece: So yeah okay let’s do Monday
[2020/07/25, 11:29:01] Reece: Before our meeting with Dick
[2020/07/25, 11:29:05] Philani: Okay cool. That works too ✌🏾
[2020/07/25, 11:29:17] Bangie: Dick? 😂😂😂
[2020/07/25, 11:29:33] Reece: Dick is short for Richard
[2020/07/25, 11:31:21] Dino: Awe ✌🏼
[2020/07/25, 11:31:30] Dino: Jesse please come back before then ❤️
[2020/07/25, 11:40:49] Bangie: Guys is that OS tut quiz for marks ?
[2020/07/25, 11:41:49] Chloë: 🤷🏽‍♀️I would suggest doing it anyway though
[2020/07/25, 11:42:03] Bangie: Did you do it Chloe ?
[2020/07/25, 11:42:10] Chloë: Not yet
[2020/07/25, 11:42:29] Bangie: I’m sure it will be based on the second lecture
[2020/07/27, 11:34:57] Dino: The quiz is insanely easy, the questions are super straight forward and the answers can be found in the slides ✌🏼
[2020/07/27, 11:35:09] Dino: Should we meet at 3:30?
[2020/07/27, 11:35:17] Chloë: Noiiiice
[2020/07/27, 11:35:26] Chloë: Yeah that works for me
[2020/07/27, 11:35:31] Bangie: That’s fine by me
[2020/07/27, 11:35:38] Bangie: Is there a lab today ?
[2020/07/27, 11:35:49] Reece: Dude I say we meet after we meet with Richard
[2020/07/27, 11:36:10] Reece: Cause we’ll have more direction after speaking to him
[2020/07/27, 11:36:33] Dino: This actually makes a lot more sense, I’m happy with that ✌🏼
[2020/07/27, 11:36:43] Reece: Also is Jesse still MIA? 😂
[2020/07/27, 11:37:43] Dino: He still hasn’t read the messages from Friday so yeah 😂
[2020/07/27, 11:38:17] Philani: Cool. Thanks for the heads up.
[2020/07/27, 11:38:33] Philani: I think so.
[2020/07/27, 11:38:43] Chloë: Eish
[2020/07/27, 11:38:44] Philani: I agree ✌🏾
[2020/07/27, 11:39:16] Dino: Of course 🙏🏼
[2020/07/27, 11:39:52] Dino: Yeah Brendan posted a thing on moodle saying the lab will be available today at 14:15
[2020/07/27, 11:42:35] Bangie: Awe solid so whoever wants we can do the lab before our meeting with Richard
[2020/07/27, 12:02:23] Jesse: Yi
[2020/07/27, 12:02:24] Jesse: Yo
[2020/07/27, 12:12:11] Reece: JESSO
[2020/07/27, 12:12:24] Reece: Glad you’re alive broski
[2020/07/27, 12:12:44] Reece: We have a meeting with Richard at 4 and a group meeting after that
[2020/07/27, 12:29:31] Dino: Ay the man is alive
‎[2020/07/27, 14:02:14] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/27, 14:02:45] Dino: That’s too accurate 😂😂
[2020/07/27, 14:52:54] Bangie: Guys anyone looked at the lab 😂
[2020/07/27, 15:13:52] Dino: Nah, what’s it like?
[2020/07/27, 15:14:17] Bangie: Writing assembly code it’s not hard because it’s given
[2020/07/27, 15:14:25] Bangie: But it’s confusing to understand
[2020/07/27, 15:21:02] Dino: Oh awe
[2020/07/27, 15:36:02] Philani: Where do I get the link for the meeting today?
[2020/07/27, 15:37:09] Bangie: https://meet.google.com/eni-wnau-fam
[2020/07/27, 15:37:25] Philani: Cool thanks ✌🏾
[2020/07/27, 15:59:05] Jesse: Will be 5 mins late
[2020/07/27, 16:05:15] Jesse: are you guys still waiting to join aswell?
[2020/07/27, 16:05:30] Dino: Nah you might be on the wrong email
[2020/07/27, 16:07:47] Dino: +27 64 686 7274
[2020/07/27, 16:16:53] Reece: https://meet.google.com/soj-sfjf-nju
[2020/07/27, 16:18:03] Dino: Awe ✌🏼
[2020/07/28, 13:31:59] Philani: Are we meeting Richard at 2 or 2:30?
[2020/07/28, 13:48:12] Reece: 2
[2020/07/28, 13:48:14] Reece: 30
[2020/07/28, 13:48:49] Philani: Cool thanks
[2020/07/28, 14:04:53] Chloë: So guys I was thinking that today we should set up our repo so we can commit to it from the terminal
[2020/07/28, 14:05:16] Chloë: https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html
[2020/07/28, 14:05:37] Chloë: I'm looking through this now, it also links to some github resources in it as well
[2020/07/28, 14:06:28] Reece: How have you been doing it before?
[2020/07/28, 14:07:40] Chloë: Well my stuff was never connected to anyone else's, so I just uploaded the whole thing when I was done 🤣
[2020/07/28, 14:08:01] Chloë: I want to start actually using git bash for something useful 🙃
[2020/07/28, 14:11:24] Reece: Yeah but how? Like on the website?
[2020/07/28, 14:18:33] Dino: Oh fair enough 😂
[2020/07/28, 14:18:55] Dino: I just push and commit straight from WebStorm
[2020/07/28, 14:19:04] Chloë: Yuuuuuuup I've been too lazy to set up anything else
[2020/07/28, 14:19:18] Bangie: It’s hella easy on the terminal though
[2020/07/28, 14:19:33] Bangie: I’ll send you the commands chloe if you’d like
[2020/07/28, 14:19:40] Chloë: linux or git bash?
[2020/07/28, 14:19:46] Bangie: Linux
[2020/07/28, 14:19:53] Chloë: That would be great, thanks Bangie
[2020/07/28, 18:54:35] Bangie: Guys I know this is a bit out there but does anyone have their labs from first year IDSA
[2020/07/28, 20:08:09] Dino: I think I probably do ✌🏼
[2020/07/28, 20:15:13] Bangie: Thanks bro , Reece sent it to me though
‎[2020/07/28, 22:46:29] Dino: ‎video omitted
‎[2020/07/28, 22:46:29] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/28, 22:46:42] Dino: So that was easy 😂
[2020/07/28, 22:48:33] Dino: And I made it so that it automatically names the file Graph_questionType_questionCode but we can obviously change that accordingly
[2020/07/29, 09:30:50] Chloë: https://youtu.be/53me-ICi_f8
[2020/07/29, 11:00:09] Philani: Nice work, man! ✌🏾
[2020/07/30, 17:55:41] Dino: Should we maybe have a meeting tomorrow? Also so that Jesse can get up to speed and hear about the new plan of action 🙏🏼
[2020/07/30, 18:19:34] Reece: I’m good with that
[2020/07/30, 18:25:23] Chloë: Same here
[2020/07/30, 18:31:59] Jesse: 🙏
[2020/07/30, 18:44:53] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/07/30, 18:53:02] Philani: Can we please maybe have it earlier like 12:30? I've got some stuff I need to do in the afternoon.
[2020/07/30, 18:53:13] Philani: If not then someone can just fill me in.
[2020/07/30, 18:57:46] Bangie: Same here 🙈
[2020/07/30, 19:03:28] Reece: 12:30 is good
[2020/07/30, 19:05:15] Dino: I’m also cool with that. Jesse is that chilled with you?✌🏼
[2020/07/30, 19:12:06] Chloë: 👌🏼
[2020/07/30, 19:21:55] Jesse: 💪💪
[2020/07/30, 19:22:04] Jesse: That's good
[2020/07/31, 11:30:18] Bangie: Sup guys my lights just cut , I don’t think it’s load shedding though so I might not make it for the meeting . I’m trying to see if I can use my mother’s pc
[2020/07/31, 11:36:16] Chloë: Alright
[2020/07/31, 11:36:35] Bangie: I can still message her worst case scenario 😂
[2020/07/31, 11:36:40] Bangie: Here*
[2020/07/31, 11:37:04] Chloë: Eh I mean that'd probably be fine tbh
[2020/07/31, 11:38:11] Dino: Yeah don’t stress man ✌🏼
[2020/07/31, 12:31:58] Chloë: Okay guys so who's got what to talk/ask about?
[2020/07/31, 12:32:21] Reece: Someone start the meeting
[2020/07/31, 12:32:29] Reece: I can’t from this app for some reason
[2020/07/31, 12:32:50] Philani: I've started one
[2020/07/31, 12:39:28] Jesse: Almost there
[2020/07/31, 12:39:29] Jesse: Sorry
[2020/07/31, 14:17:02] Dino: Guys I just thought of something. Pravesh wants the file download/upload thing so that students don’t have to be online when they work right. But if our actual HTML interface is in a server then they still have to have an internet connection to use it?
[2020/07/31, 14:17:19] Chloë: No
[2020/07/31, 14:17:44] Chloë: He's handling the deployment, so it'll be like when we can use Moodle but not access the wider internet
[2020/07/31, 14:17:53] Chloë: Is what I assume
[2020/07/31, 14:18:37] Dino: Oh yes that’s exactly it ! The server he puts it in will be zero rated 🙏🏼
‎[2020/07/31, 14:22:55] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/07/31, 14:23:24] Reece: Yes
[2020/07/31, 14:23:41] Chloë: Yes, tree
[2020/07/31, 14:27:22] Dino: 😂😂 manual labour
[2020/08/03, 20:14:44] Jesse: Hello team
[2020/08/03, 20:15:09] Jesse: You must be tank now
[2020/08/03, 20:15:23] Jesse: Shall we meet sometime?
[2020/08/03, 20:19:08] Reece: 4 U Anytime
[2020/08/03, 20:19:16] Jesse: Ah boy
[2020/08/03, 20:19:22] Jesse: You're so special
[2020/08/03, 20:20:00] Reece: 🌝
[2020/08/03, 21:34:47] Jesse: Come reece get on teams
[2020/08/03, 21:36:06] Jesse: Shit you actually might, I was just tryna make a joke
[2020/08/04, 10:20:31] Dino: I’m keen 🤞🏼 did you manage to figure out the file stuff?
[2020/08/04, 11:22:50] Chloë: Are we having a proper meeting today or just whatsapp? /when are we meeting
[2020/08/04, 11:28:45] Philani: I'm chilled with WhatsApp
[2020/08/04, 11:29:02] Dino: Yeah same, we can have a proper meeting tomorrow maybe?
[2020/08/04, 11:29:08] Philani: All I've done is the Taiga stuff, so I don't need to really explain anything 😂
[2020/08/04, 11:29:19] Philani: That works with me
[2020/08/04, 11:29:43] Chloë: I saw, I still can't get into Taiga :(((((((
[2020/08/04, 11:29:49] Chloë: Same
[2020/08/04, 11:30:24] Philani: I couldn't get into it earlier today, then I disabled my antivirus and it let me in. Could be that.
[2020/08/04, 11:30:57] Chloë: was it a 404 not found error?
[2020/08/04, 11:31:35] Philani: Oh no it wasn't that 😅 I would try to log in, but it would just go blank and wouldn't reload the page.
[2020/08/04, 15:30:02] Chloë: This did fix it though, thank youuuu ✨
[2020/08/04, 16:51:36] Philani: No stress ✌🏾
‎[2020/08/04, 23:32:32] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/05, 10:28:22] Jesse: ohh shit
[2020/08/05, 10:28:34] Jesse: dank asf
[2020/08/05, 10:33:01] Bangie: I’m almost done as well with the arrow shit on the directed edges , just need to work on some if statements for certain shit
[2020/08/05, 10:35:28] Jesse: Mooi
[2020/08/05, 16:47:18] Dino: Let’s have a meeting tomorrow?🤞🏼
[2020/08/05, 16:51:03] Bangie: Cool with me 👌
[2020/08/05, 16:57:42] Reece: Dino the MVP
[2020/08/05, 16:58:16] Reece: Seconded
[2020/08/05, 20:58:26] Chloë: 👌🏼
[2020/08/05, 22:47:34] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/08/05, 23:20:22] Philani: I just randomly checked and it looks like SD marks are out.
[2020/08/05, 23:24:59] Reece: The fact that you felt the need to emphasize the “randomness” of your aforementioned check, makes me feel like you’ve _actually_ been checking every day every hour on the hour out of anticipation
[2020/08/05, 23:26:54] Dino: 😂😂
[2020/08/05, 23:26:55] Philani: I don't know about all that 😂 I did check the last 2 days, though, I'll give you that 😂
[2020/08/05, 23:27:08] Dino: All our marks should be the same right?
[2020/08/05, 23:27:20] Dino: Does this mean we’re not having an exam for SD either?😅
[2020/08/05, 23:27:23] Reece: Did you get 91
[2020/08/05, 23:27:57] Reece: Yoh fuck I hope so 😂
[2020/08/05, 23:28:19] Philani: Nah I think that this is just our continuous assessment mark and the exam will weigh 50%
[2020/08/05, 23:28:30] Philani: But this would be sick 😂
[2020/08/05, 23:28:36] Philani: Yeah
[2020/08/05, 23:28:48] Reece: Then yeah
[2020/08/05, 23:28:59] Reece: Good job team
[2020/08/05, 23:30:06] Philani: Yeah, nice guys 🙏🏾
[2020/08/05, 23:56:57] Chloë: Lol at least it's something nice to show when the parents ask 🤣
[2020/08/06, 00:06:31] Dino: We killed it guys⚡️
[2020/08/06, 00:06:47] Dino: So I guess “is that it?” ended up actually being enough
[2020/08/06, 00:29:00] Reece: Nah bro the “is that it” lost us that 9%
[2020/08/06, 11:39:20] Dino: Fair enough 🥺😂
[2020/08/06, 11:39:26] Dino: Everyone cool with 1?🤞🏼
[2020/08/06, 11:40:36] Jesse: Can we maybe make it 3?
[2020/08/06, 11:50:50] Philani: I'm chilled with that 👍🏾
[2020/08/06, 11:58:56] Dino: Me too ✌🏼
[2020/08/06, 12:05:37] Reece: As am I
[2020/08/06, 14:05:33] Chloë: Same
[2020/08/06, 14:35:05] Jesse: can someone pls give me a name of a graph on firebase so I can see something quick
[2020/08/06, 14:35:21] Jesse: there's one called freebobby or something?
[2020/08/06, 14:39:21] Bangie: Yeah freebobby is one
[2020/08/06, 14:49:54] Reece: A classic
[2020/08/06, 14:53:03] Dino: I might be 10 mins late
[2020/08/06, 14:57:26] Reece: We can just start at like 3:15?
[2020/08/06, 14:59:20] Dino: Nah it’s cool I’ll be there by 15:05

[2020/08/06, 19:23:30] Dino: Guys for one of the sprints I rate we add an option for the user to change between light mode and dark mode, because it will really only be a few if statements and color changes, and it could be really cool 😂🙏🏼
[2020/08/06, 19:24:24] Chloë: And maybe we can play around with css, change the look and feel, maybe even options for themes other than light and dark if we're feeling spicy
[2020/08/06, 19:24:38] Chloë: Great idea
[2020/08/06, 19:25:01] Dino: I back it, we could have a mini settings tab that pops out from the side !
[2020/08/06, 19:25:34] Chloë: I'd love to put some work in on that
‎[2020/08/06, 19:25:56] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/06, 19:26:29] Dino: Awesome 😁 we'll do that for a later sprint when we're bored though
[2020/08/06, 19:26:44] Dino: Found this font and I think it's great
[2020/08/06, 19:27:24] Philani: Some fire ideas 👌🏾

[2020/08/06, 19:30:39] Dino: This is a pretty cool style
[2020/08/06, 19:31:46] Dino: I mean the way the settings panel works
[2020/08/06, 20:26:40] Jesse: Very nice ideas
[2020/08/06, 20:27:04] Jesse: Ill also try to think of cool things to add
[2020/08/07, 10:16:26] Jesse: Wassup guys
[2020/08/07, 10:16:52] Jesse: Which pages must i go through for the tut due today
[2020/08/07, 10:18:01] Chloë: The OS tut is really easy, just go through the slides while you do it
[2020/08/07, 10:18:13] Chloë: The answers are verbatim in there
[2020/08/07, 10:18:17] Jesse: Siiiik
[2020/08/07, 10:20:08] Dino: Just Ctrl+F on the PDF to search for the keywords and it’s quick quick
[2020/08/07, 10:21:11] Bangie: I sent the answers on the group bro
[2020/08/07, 10:22:10] Jesse: Oh shit i see
[2020/08/07, 10:22:11] Jesse: Haha
[2020/08/07, 10:22:20] Jesse: ❤️
[2020/08/07, 21:04:36] Chloë: We're with Londani at 2pm on Tuesday, got the email invitation
[2020/08/09, 19:13:35] Dino: Guys having the fire base thing is creating a lot of extra work, and it’s not really necessary because we don’t actually use it for pravesh. Could we just get rid of it?
[2020/08/09, 19:46:03] Jesse: Fine with me
[2020/08/09, 20:03:04] Reece: Yeah bro
‎[2020/08/09, 20:09:28] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/09, 20:11:48] Reece: I have never seen checkout and merge in my life
[2020/08/09, 20:13:29] Jesse: Wow
[2020/08/09, 20:13:40] Jesse: Makes me feel lost
[2020/08/09, 20:14:44] Jesse: Ill be honest with you guys, i still haven't set it up with my ide. I just use it manually on the web page
[2020/08/09, 21:00:43] Chloë: I just set it up last time I mentioned it 🤦🏽‍♀️
[2020/08/09, 21:00:51] Chloë: Github desktop really helps
[2020/08/10, 12:35:30] Reece: How’s everything going guys?
[2020/08/10, 12:38:07] Dino: It’s coming along ✌🏼 I think the student interface is pretty much sorted. Lecture side still needs a fair amount of work but I’m not too fussed about that right now. I asked pravesh if he’s available to meet today but I forgot it’s a public holiday so we’ll see what he says
[2020/08/10, 12:38:29] Bangie: Is it true we have a new tutor ??
[2020/08/10, 12:38:48] Dino: Yebo
[2020/08/10, 12:39:08] Bangie: Is that a good thing ?
[2020/08/10, 12:39:22] Reece: Awe lemme know if you need an assist
[2020/08/10, 12:39:36] Dino: Depends if she knows what a graph is 😅
[2020/08/10, 12:39:44] Philani: I'm almost done writing tests for the java code Chloë uploaded. And I'm gonna add the arrows stuff that Goolam recently did on Taiga
[2020/08/10, 12:39:58] Reece: Maybe not hey, considering that we got 91 from the other guy
[2020/08/10, 12:40:13] Dino: Awesome work man ⚡️
[2020/08/10, 12:40:58] Philani: Hopefully 😂😅
[2020/08/10, 12:41:07] Philani: Thanks man 🙏🏾
[2020/08/10, 12:43:07] Bangie: I get you with regards to her knowing nothing maybe
[2020/08/10, 12:43:23] Bangie: But the nice thing is we can repeat some use cases that we did before if we can’t think of any
[2020/08/10, 12:44:33] Dino: This is true !
[2020/08/10, 13:24:43] Dino: I’ve done a little bit of shit that wasn’t entirely necessary for this sprint 🤦🏻‍♂️ so I’m gonna create a new branch and then push to that for now, so we can use some of the things as user stories for the next sprint ✌🏼
[2020/08/10, 15:36:54] Dino: Pravesh isn’t replying, should we have a meeting anyway?
[2020/08/10, 15:40:33] Philani: I'm chilled with that.
[2020/08/10, 16:50:04] Dino: And everybody else just not gonna reply?😴
[2020/08/10, 16:50:26] Bangie: Sorry bro I’m not at home at the moment
[2020/08/10, 16:50:29] Bangie: I’ll be home soon
[2020/08/10, 17:14:09] Reece: Yeah bro same
[2020/08/10, 17:14:21] Reece: Can we meet tonight?
[2020/08/10, 17:14:24] Reece: At like 8
[2020/08/10, 17:20:22] Philani: Yoh 😂 yeah that works for me.
[2020/08/10, 17:20:53] Dino: I wish I had something better to do at 8pm but I’m cool with that 😂
[2020/08/10, 17:21:44] Bangie: That’s fine for me
[2020/08/10, 18:16:58] Chloë: Yeah I can do that, I should be free by then
[2020/08/10, 18:17:12] Chloë: Sorry guys, it's been an unexpectedly busy day
[2020/08/10, 18:29:57] Jesse: I wont be 😖 been helping my dad with stuff and getting home late
[2020/08/10, 18:31:51] Jesse: Chloe knows everything i know
[2020/08/10, 18:32:02] Jesse: And ill be able to commit alles as soon as I get home
[2020/08/10, 18:32:47] Dino: Okay sweet no stress. What more have you done?
[2020/08/10, 18:33:02] Jesse: The java classes stuff
[2020/08/10, 18:33:07] Jesse: For pravesh
[2020/08/10, 18:33:48] Dino: Awee. We really just need to check that everything is in line for tomorrow
[2020/08/10, 18:34:13] Jesse: I can be available for call later on as well
[2020/08/10, 20:03:25] Philani: I've started a meeting
[2020/08/10, 20:09:23] Dino: Sorry guys my laptop died give me 2 secs
[2020/08/10, 20:10:02] Chloë: Coming
[2020/08/10, 23:25:35] Chloë: The Converter class is the one for tomorrow, the JsonToObject class is the thing I'll work on for next sprint if it works out
[2020/08/10, 23:25:49] Chloë: I'm testing the Converter class tonight, should be all done by morning
[2020/08/10, 23:45:00] Chloë: I should have asked about value as well for the Vertex class, but I'm gonna go with it being a string, since for a lot of the tuts we had vertices with actual names and not just numbers
[2020/08/10, 23:49:31] Bangie: The thing about the string is that it could represent names and “numbers” like 0 can be represented as a string as well
[2020/08/11, 00:05:27] Chloë: Yeah it's just for Java it's a bit more annoying than JavaScript, just have to be sure. Doesn't matter for how it gets sent to the object, Pravesh can deal with that per question
[2020/08/11, 00:05:34] Dino: Nice ✌🏼
[2020/08/11, 00:05:40] Dino: I rate keep the value as a string
[2020/08/11, 00:05:53] Chloë: 👍🏼
‎[2020/08/11, 11:52:16] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/11, 11:53:08] Philani: No stress ✌🏾
[2020/08/11, 11:59:00] Chloë: Sick 😌 thanks Philani
[2020/08/11, 13:56:06] Jesse: is this gonna be done on google meets?
[2020/08/11, 13:56:22] Dino: Yeah check your email
[2020/08/11, 13:57:04] Jesse: coo
[2020/08/11, 13:57:05] Jesse: cool
[2020/08/11, 13:58:27] Jesse: I just added something to the github now
[2020/08/11, 13:58:42] Jesse: is that a problem because it wont be on the latest release or something?
[2020/08/11, 13:59:21] Philani: Nah should be fine.
[2020/08/11, 13:59:36] Jesse: dankie
[2020/08/11, 13:59:50] Reece: Nah dawg our release is just there so we get marks for having a release 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:01:17] Jesse: oh hectic
[2020/08/11, 14:01:18] Jesse: xD
[2020/08/11, 14:02:41] Reece: I already hate this guy
[2020/08/11, 14:06:23] Chloë: cryinggggggggg at the moodle plugin
[2020/08/11, 14:10:19] Chloë: This man is nuts if he thinks we can upload this chat as a text file 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:10:30] Reece: Dawg
[2020/08/11, 14:10:49] Reece: I’m so glad Dino scrolled up from this before he shared 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:10:56] Dino: When I opened the chat it was on this message, luckily I managed to scroll in time 😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:11:00] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:11:00] Dino: ^^ 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:11:06] Chloë: LOL I know, I was silently praying for you
[2020/08/11, 14:12:22] Chloë: This is horrid
[2020/08/11, 14:12:27] Dino: Check in 😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:12:36] Chloë: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2020/08/11, 14:13:39] Jesse: imagine we copy this part of the chat into our txt file for the next sprint xP
[2020/08/11, 14:13:57] Chloë: _dude_
[2020/08/11, 14:13:57] Reece: Dawg fuck this guy
[2020/08/11, 14:14:19] Dino: This is so annoying
[2020/08/11, 14:14:26] Chloë: I feel like there should be some rule against having to submit something that incriminates yourself 🤣
[2020/08/11, 14:14:37] Dino: Philani click on it faster dude come on 😴😴😴
[2020/08/11, 14:14:51] Dino: This man is so impatient 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:14:54] Philani: My bad 😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:14:58] Chloë: We're spending so much time on useless shit.... I get this course is about the project management side of things but seriously, I feel like we don't have the time for him to sit and read everything
[2020/08/11, 14:15:07] Dino: Nah I’m joking man 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:15:26] Dino: Agreed
[2020/08/11, 14:16:24] Dino: Joh this is too much 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:16:28] Chloë: Why would he wait for you to close it to ask...........
[2020/08/11, 14:16:44] Reece: Guess not guys
[2020/08/11, 14:16:56] Philani: Bra that was what I was thinking 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:17:08] Chloë: LOL
[2020/08/11, 14:17:24] Dino: Eish he’s gonna look at every single diagram now....
[2020/08/11, 14:17:30] Dino: So true 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:18:03] Reece: I miss Pierce
[2020/08/11, 14:18:03] Jesse: ey guys
[2020/08/11, 14:18:12] Jesse: lets not forget the first tutor we had
[2020/08/11, 14:18:14] Dino: I’m just gonna have a nap, wake me up when it’s my turn
[2020/08/11, 14:18:18] Philani: Bro I'm finished 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:18:22] Dino: Fair enough
[2020/08/11, 14:18:26] Reece: Fair enough
[2020/08/11, 14:18:41] Jesse: fuuuck 😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:18:50] Philani: He takes so long for the admin, imagine when he sees the code 🙆🏾‍♂️😂
[2020/08/11, 14:18:56] Chloë: At least he bowed out when he knew he didn't know what was going on, why are we spending 20 min on diagrams
[2020/08/11, 14:19:07] Dino: I’m gonna cry if he wants to see the code 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:19:13] Jesse: haha
[2020/08/11, 14:19:17] Dino: For real, this is ridiculous
[2020/08/11, 14:19:41] Chloë: These meetings never took more than half an hour 😭
[2020/08/11, 14:20:39] Dino: Gee Philani relax, why you rushing dude
[2020/08/11, 14:20:42] Dino: 😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:20:46] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:20:56] Philani: I'm trying so hard not to laugh 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:21:02] Jesse: just tell him thats all the diagrams xD
[2020/08/11, 14:21:07] Dino: I don’t know how you’re not 😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:21:19] Philani: Then we lose marks 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:22:36] Chloë: Somehow only getting worse
[2020/08/11, 14:23:19] Chloë: Oh shit we didn't say we're using the internet, no one knows what these diagrams mean anymore
[2020/08/11, 14:23:42] Dino: Bruh 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:23:50] Dino: Dankie Reece 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:24:00] Chloë: Coming in clutch
[2020/08/11, 14:24:10] Philani: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:25:53] Dino: We don’t have a readme...
[2020/08/11, 14:26:28] Philani: I think he just wants to see the badges.
[2020/08/11, 14:26:41] Dino: Aha
[2020/08/11, 14:27:00] Chloë: I can do a little readme this sprint just for some instructions, students shouldn't need to install this thing so they just need to know how to use it
[2020/08/11, 14:28:18] Reece: We’re not even gonna get to the actual project ...
[2020/08/11, 14:28:38] Chloë: 17 minutes left...
[2020/08/11, 14:28:42] Dino: Better for me 😜
[2020/08/11, 14:28:51] Reece: Dino bruh I have a feeling he’s gonna ask you to show him all the code 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:28:52] Chloë: Clearly he's not worried about seeing what we actually did
[2020/08/11, 14:28:58] Reece: Then he finna read it
[2020/08/11, 14:29:01] Dino: Same 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:29:14] Chloë: Scroll down.... _slowly_
[2020/08/11, 14:29:35] Dino: Joh Philani this guy is just making you his bitch 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:30:01] Dino: 😂😂 again
[2020/08/11, 14:30:14] Chloë: So glad we're on mute, I have no idea how you're not laughing Philani
[2020/08/11, 14:30:31] Dino: Even me, I’m canning myself 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:31:03] Philani: Dude for real 😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:31:23] Philani: I'm legit dying 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:33:09] Reece: Click on it Philani
[2020/08/11, 14:33:12] Reece: God damn it
[2020/08/11, 14:34:25] Jesse: good shit bangie
[2020/08/11, 14:34:44] Dino: Saved the day
[2020/08/11, 14:34:45] Philani: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:34:46] Chloë: This is actually insane
[2020/08/11, 14:34:55] Philani: Coming in clutch 🤞🏾
[2020/08/11, 14:35:58] Dino: Nah this is just annoying now
[2020/08/11, 14:36:01] Chloë: Actually that's a good-ass point, we have all these diagrams but we don't actually ever just have a paragraph 🤣
[2020/08/11, 14:36:13] Chloë: 9 minutes left...
[2020/08/11, 14:36:26] Chloë: Still haven't shown a single thing of our actual product
[2020/08/11, 14:36:41] Chloë: What.......
[2020/08/11, 14:36:55] Dino: Umm wut the fuck
[2020/08/11, 14:37:23] Chloë: Seriously what the fuck??????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2020/08/11, 14:37:43] Philani: I'm finished 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:37:48] Chloë: I am confusion
[2020/08/11, 14:38:13] Dino: I’m not gonna bother with the interface then 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:39:02] Reece: Dawg
[2020/08/11, 14:39:04] Philani: What the fk was that? 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:39:09] Reece: We didn’t have to do anything lmao
[2020/08/11, 14:39:20] Jesse: lol\
[2020/08/11, 14:39:34] Jesse: couldn't chilled the whole time xP
[2020/08/11, 14:39:36] Reece: Are we gonna have a meeting now?
[2020/08/11, 14:39:37] Bangie: We could literally just show this guy another teams project and he wouldn’t know anything
[2020/08/11, 14:39:38] Jesse: couldve
[2020/08/11, 14:39:40] Philani: Like legit. He better give us good marks for this cause that was a lot of work 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:39:49] Philani: For real 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:40:02] Jesse: please can I eat lunch first
[2020/08/11, 14:40:02] Chloë: Ya neh.....
[2020/08/11, 14:40:26] Chloë: Yeah let's, quick snackie break for Jesse first though
[2020/08/11, 14:40:41] Reece: 4 sho Jesso
[2020/08/11, 14:40:45] Reece: Let’s say 4?
[2020/08/11, 14:41:04] Chloë: Can't do 4, but don't stress about me, just let me know what you need me to do
[2020/08/11, 14:41:20] Chloë: Jesse's got everything
[2020/08/11, 14:41:52] Philani: Should we not wait till we meet with Pravesh so we know where to go from there? Cause what are we gonna discuss in the meeting now?
[2020/08/11, 14:42:09] Dino: Yeah that makes more sense
[2020/08/11, 14:42:13] Chloë: I don't have anything in particular to say/ask
[2020/08/11, 14:42:16] Dino: And we still have a while until the next sprint
[2020/08/11, 14:42:23] Dino: Me neither
[2020/08/11, 14:42:26] Reece: Awes
[2020/08/11, 14:42:53] Philani: So we just gotta message Pravesh and set up a meeting with him for this week.
[2020/08/11, 14:42:58] Philani: I can email him.
[2020/08/11, 14:43:16] Chloë: Awesome
[2020/08/11, 14:43:26] Philani: Unless he's already responded to you Dino?
[2020/08/11, 14:43:28] Philani: 😂😂
[2020/08/11, 14:43:53] Reece: The more the merrier
[2020/08/11, 14:44:19] Dino: Negative
[2020/08/11, 14:44:31] Philani: True😂
[2020/08/11, 14:44:31] Dino: Please email him 😂🙏🏼 I don’t wanna be a clingy bitch
[2020/08/11, 14:44:46] Philani: Awe I'll get on it 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:44:52] Dino: Guys I honestly feel like we’re working on 2 different projects, one for pravesh, and then one for marks 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:45:32] Philani: So true 😂
[2020/08/11, 14:53:34] Bangie: I doubt that 😂
[2020/08/11, 15:47:20] Jesse: 😝
[2020/08/11, 15:47:40] Jesse: Itd be cool to see our shit in action with the 2nd year's
[2020/08/13, 09:36:01] Jesse: I had an idea or 2 about extra shit we can put in.
[2020/08/13, 09:36:25] Jesse: 1 idea was maybe include like a hint button for the student to practice with
[2020/08/13, 09:43:15] Dino: Ooo I really dig that ! So like for BFS/DFS, we could change the color of an edge that is there and shouldn’t be there. And then for graph coloring we could change the color or 2 vertices that clash
[2020/08/13, 09:43:40] Jesse: Yes!!!
[2020/08/13, 09:43:46] Jesse: Thats it 😁
[2020/08/13, 09:54:55] Bangie: And like if you think about it our markers have like a flag when something messes up on their side right
[2020/08/13, 10:16:12] Jesse: Yeah, so we'd have to link this code into the markers. Ive been thinking about how to tackle it with my markers but we obviously need to have a meeting and talk it through first I think 🙃
[2020/08/13, 10:17:32] Jesse: Essentially just adding more info to the flag so instead it saying. "wrong answer", rather it says "wrong answer because edge 5-6 is incorrect" or something like that
[2020/08/13, 10:28:55] Dino: That would work but the problem would come up when they’ve made more than one error. So maybe what we could do is create an incorrectGraph object, and store all the vertices and edges that are incorrect for whatever reason it may be, and we could even store some more specific details. And then we can compare that to their graph and only change the color of the incorrect stuff
[2020/08/13, 10:30:12] Jesse: Yeah thats actually a really good idea
[2020/08/13, 10:30:40] Jesse: I was originally just think of an array of edges and vertices but a graph works better
[2020/08/13, 10:31:06] Jesse: We may need to pass additional info across aswell
[2020/08/13, 10:31:32] Jesse: But i would need to think in more depth about this
[2020/08/13, 10:31:59] Dino: For sure ✌🏼 we’ll also speak to Pravesh about it to see what he thinks 🙏🏼 has anyone heard back from him?😅
[2020/08/13, 10:32:11] Jesse: Cool cool
[2020/08/13, 10:32:12] Jesse: Nope
[2020/08/13, 10:33:28] Bangie: Like with graph coloring , the one flag is set to false when two adjacent vertices have the same color right , so we’d be able to identify which two vertices when the flag is set to false
[2020/08/13, 10:35:55] Jesse: Yebo yebo yes
[2020/08/13, 10:37:50] Jesse: Another cool idea i had was to implement an auto spacer, its definitely not as useful as hints but it would just be cool to see it in action 😂😂 so what I mean is when the button is clicked, the graph will automatically space itself out in a neat way
[2020/08/13, 10:38:17] Jesse: I know of a couple of algorithms to do this
[2020/08/13, 10:46:44] Bangie: Jesse hit some inspiration in his dream last night 😂
[2020/08/13, 10:47:36] Reece: *Jesse got high last night
[2020/08/13, 10:51:15] Jesse: 😂😂

[2020/08/13, 10:52:55] Dino: Ah guys we forgot to say check in, now this meeting won’t count 🙄
[2020/08/13, 10:53:20] Bangie: Guys don’t forget there’s an SD quiz that closes tonight at 10
[2020/08/13, 10:58:18] Philani: Nope he still hasn't gotten back to me. Maybe we could message him on WhatsApp
[2020/08/13, 10:58:36] Chloë: 🤣🤣🤣😂
[2020/08/13, 10:58:38] Philani: 😂😂
[2020/08/13, 10:59:01] Chloë: Now that is spicy
[2020/08/13, 10:59:07] Dino: Has she uploaded it yet? Last time I checked it wasn’t there
[2020/08/13, 10:59:28] Chloë: Wow actual things to hand in for SD?
[2020/08/13, 11:01:17] Dino: Wait do you not mean parallel computing?😕
[2020/08/13, 11:01:46] Philani: I think he did. I started panicking when I saw SD 😅
[2020/08/13, 11:01:54] Reece: Same
[2020/08/13, 11:02:10] Reece: Literally went on to moodle to check 😂
[2020/08/13, 11:02:37] Chloë: Okay 😂
[2020/08/13, 11:20:15] Bangie: Not SD , PC
[2020/08/13, 11:23:17] Philani: I just checked and it's still not up. Or am I missing something? 😅
[2020/08/13, 11:26:58] Philani: Never mind

[2020/08/14, 13:28:14] Dino: Just wanted to remind you guys about the meeting today because I almost forgot 😅

[2020/08/14, 14:45:07] Bangie: Nothing to say
[2020/08/14, 15:10:09] Reece: 😂😂😂
[2020/08/14, 15:31:54] Reece: Have we confirmed with Pravesh that the meeting is still on?
[2020/08/14, 15:39:07] Philani: He was the one who said 4 and messaged me the link for Google Meets. He better show up 😂😅
[2020/08/14, 15:46:58] Reece: You know how he is though
[2020/08/14, 15:47:50] Dino: Let’s have faith
[2020/08/14, 16:02:12] Jesse: please share the link with me
[2020/08/14, 16:02:22] Reece: .
[2020/08/14, 16:02:33] Chloë: .
[2020/08/14, 16:02:51] Philani: Okay awe I'm in it ✌🏾
[2020/08/14, 16:03:17] Reece: Let me in Philani
[2020/08/14, 16:03:23] Dino: Fuck guys the power just went out but I’m at the girls house and they’ve got a generator so we’re sorting it out quick
[2020/08/14, 16:03:36] Dino: I won’t be long though
[2020/08/14, 16:03:48] Jesse: oh yea
[2020/08/14, 16:03:53] Jesse: loadshedding today at 4
[2020/08/14, 16:04:08] Philani: It's how do I do that? There's no option to do that.
[2020/08/14, 16:04:22] Reece: I don’t know
[2020/08/14, 16:04:28] Reece: But it won’t let me join on my own
[2020/08/14, 16:04:29] Dino: Pravesh probably has to because he created it
[2020/08/14, 16:04:36] Reece: I’m guessing Pravesh only invited you
[2020/08/14, 16:04:45] Philani: He's not even in it.
[2020/08/14, 16:04:45] Jesse: haha
[2020/08/14, 16:04:47] Chloë: So I guess we're waiting for him then 😂
[2020/08/14, 16:04:56] Philani: Let me email him.
[2020/08/14, 16:05:02] Dino: Eish man 😂😂😂
[2020/08/14, 16:05:11] Reece: This guy
[2020/08/14, 16:05:48] Jesse: ah well
[2020/08/14, 16:05:56] Chloë: F
[2020/08/14, 16:07:23] Philani: Nah what the actual fk? 🤦🏾‍♂️
[2020/08/14, 16:08:19] Jesse: what we gonna do
[2020/08/14, 16:09:11] Philani: Maybe give him 5 more minutes.
[2020/08/14, 16:09:23] Jesse: alright
[2020/08/14, 16:09:35] Philani: Is he like this with other lecturers? Cause this is so unprofessional 🤦🏾‍♂️
[2020/08/14, 16:09:55] Jesse: lols
[2020/08/14, 16:10:04] Jesse: i wonder
[2020/08/14, 16:11:36] Dino: Maybe he also has load shedding?😕
[2020/08/14, 16:12:07] Chloë: Yeah shame maybe there's an actual reason today 🤦🏽‍♀️
[2020/08/14, 16:12:35] Jesse: it was a good try
[2020/08/14, 16:13:43] Philani: Could be 🤷🏾‍♂️
[2020/08/14, 16:14:12] Philani: But, yeah, I rate we call it for today. I'll let you guys know if he responds to me again.
[2020/08/14, 16:14:15] Jesse: we calling it?
[2020/08/14, 16:14:22] Jesse: okay coo
[2020/08/14, 16:14:23] Jesse: cool
[2020/08/14, 16:14:25] Dino: Fuck man again
[2020/08/14, 16:14:32] Dino: He’s not getting any cool features
[2020/08/14, 16:14:38] Dino: Let’s hope so 🙈
‎[2020/08/14, 16:14:51] Chloë: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/14, 16:15:07] Chloë: Yup
[2020/08/14, 16:15:10] Philani: Those only go to lecturers that are punctual 😂
[2020/08/14, 16:15:14] Chloë: I have Hamilton to watch
[2020/08/14, 16:15:17] Reece: Ayt
[2020/08/14, 16:15:21] Reece: Let’s call it
[2020/08/14, 16:15:26] Reece: Pravesh has pulled a Pravesh
[2020/08/14, 16:15:29] Reece: Once again

[2020/08/14, 18:56:13] Dino: This guy 😂😂
[2020/08/14, 18:58:36] Dino: I love the “hey man”, it’s like fuck guys I’m sorry I’m exhausted 😂😂
‎[2020/08/16, 12:38:17] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/16, 12:59:22] Philani: 😂😅
[2020/08/16, 13:29:28] Chloë: FLA guys..........
[2020/08/16, 13:30:55] Bangie: What happened chloe ??
[2020/08/16, 13:31:19] Chloë: Nothing 🤣 but it's coming
[2020/08/16, 13:31:55] Bangie: What do you mean it’s coming 🙈
[2020/08/16, 13:33:13] Chloë: Just this meme, you know that lady's going to jump at the first opportunity to write her test, and if you guys are where I am then that means a whole semester's work to catch up
[2020/08/16, 13:34:00] Bangie: But the first test is only on that shit she already was going to be on the test from March time right
[2020/08/16, 13:34:17] Bangie: With regards to everything else in first semester what’s going on there 😂
[2020/08/16, 13:34:58] Chloë: Exam I suppose?
[2020/08/16, 13:35:13] Bangie: CGV there’s nothing right
[2020/08/16, 13:41:04] Bangie: They should just scrap fla in my opinion 😂
[2020/08/16, 13:42:03] Reece: I’ve ignored a lot of courses before
[2020/08/16, 13:42:03] Philani: That would be the greatest outcome 😂😅
[2020/08/16, 13:42:08] Reece: But never like FLA
[2020/08/16, 13:42:22] Reece: I forget it existed every time it’s mentioned
[2020/08/16, 14:33:14] Chloë: I went to half of the first lecture, and that was the last time I did anything related to FLA
[2020/08/16, 14:33:41] Chloë: Even though it now has a moodle site, for some reason it doesn't show on my dashboard which has only made it worse
[2020/08/16, 14:33:49] Chloë: I have to make a conscious decision to check
[2020/08/17, 11:19:49] Philani: Check in
[2020/08/17, 11:20:13] Philani: Also, I've emailed Pracesh again. If he doesn't respond to me I rate we just have a meeting tomorrow anyway
[2020/08/17, 11:25:56] Chloë: Check in 🙃
[2020/08/17, 11:26:02] Chloë: Definitely
[2020/08/17, 11:36:25] Dino: Check in
[2020/08/17, 11:36:36] Dino: For sure 🙏🏼
[2020/08/17, 11:44:31] Bangie: Check in
‎[2020/08/17, 11:44:57] Reece: ‎GIF omitted
[2020/08/17, 11:45:22] Reece: Guys on the real though we can’t send him this chat
[2020/08/17, 11:46:26] Jesse: Lol
[2020/08/17, 11:46:52] Dino: This is ridiculous though
[2020/08/17, 11:47:22] Philani: It really is 😪
[2020/08/17, 11:47:53] Philani: Can't we delete all the messages we don't want him to see, and export the chat 😂
[2020/08/17, 12:09:54] Jesse: Should be able to
[2020/08/17, 12:10:23] Jesse: Otherwise we maybe take zero for daily check in mark
[2020/08/17, 12:11:03] Reece: We do what we’ve always done and take what we get
[2020/08/17, 12:12:00] Reece: Plus I’m sure next sprint he’ll only ask to see the interface and the code since that’s the “focus”
[2020/08/17, 12:48:55] Chloë: That's the whole thing
[2020/08/17, 16:21:00] Bangie: Guys do we have a sprint retrospective next Tuesday
‎[2020/08/17, 16:21:51] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/17, 16:22:36] Bangie: I don’t even think the guy remembers what we had in our actual project 😂
[2020/08/17, 16:23:49] Bangie: Meeting tomorrow ?
[2020/08/17, 16:41:23] Reece: Yes sir
[2020/08/17, 19:11:12] Chloë: Ye
[2020/08/17, 19:11:34] Chloë: They're all two weeks apart, cause we're supposed to start one sprint when the other ends
[2020/08/17, 19:11:45] Bangie: Makes sense
[2020/08/17, 19:11:51] Chloë: Kind of impossible to do without talking to the client though 🙃
[2020/08/17, 19:12:18] Chloë: Definitely, let's do it before 4 though cause I have to go then
[2020/08/17, 20:40:07] Dino: @27835072064 have you heard back from him?🙄
[2020/08/17, 20:40:29] Bangie: Try and get a hold of Cyril it will be easier
[2020/08/17, 20:50:53] Philani: Nope, still nothing 😪
[2020/08/17, 20:51:06] Philani: So true 😂😂
[2020/08/18, 11:06:51] Philani: Still no response from Pravesh. Let's meet at 3 ✌🏾
[2020/08/18, 12:42:49] Dino: Awe ✌🏼
[2020/08/18, 14:36:11] Philani: We can reschedule if no one else can make it 😅
[2020/08/18, 14:36:38] Chloë: I'll be there
[2020/08/18, 14:40:23] Reece: Might be a lil late but I’ll be there 💪🏾
[2020/08/18, 14:41:00] Reece: So will Goolam. His silence means yes.
[2020/08/18, 14:41:08] Reece: Can’t speak for Jesso
[2020/08/18, 14:41:50] Jesse: Same
[2020/08/18, 14:48:58] Philani: Okay cool ✌🏾
[2020/08/18, 14:52:15] Dino: Same 😅
[2020/08/18, 14:52:19] Dino: Let’s start at 15:15?
[2020/08/18, 14:52:35] Jesse: Yea sounds good
[2020/08/18, 15:01:01] Chloë: Okeh okeh
[2020/08/18, 15:59:55] Philani: pravesh.ranchod@wits.ac.za
[2020/08/18, 16:00:55] Philani: ellipticalorbit@gmail.com
[2020/08/18, 16:09:55] Reece: Awe
[2020/08/18, 16:10:17] Reece: I sent it from my personal email just in case he ignores student emails
[2020/08/18, 16:10:40] Reece: I also set the subject as “URGENT”
[2020/08/18, 16:11:15] Reece: I was also pretty passive aggressive
[2020/08/18, 16:11:33] Reece: Honestly I don’t think I was the best man for this job
[2020/08/18, 16:11:42] Reece: Apologies if he hates us after this
[2020/08/18, 16:46:50] Dino: Rather you than me 😅 shot bro 😂🙏🏼
[2020/08/18, 17:18:28] Chloë: LOL
[2020/08/20, 13:10:36] Reece: Still no reply from World’s Greatest Dad
[2020/08/20, 13:26:49] Bangie: I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up but we might not write ML as well not 100% but according to Benjis suspicions we might not write
[2020/08/20, 13:27:36] Dino: You clown 😂😂
[2020/08/20, 13:27:56] Dino: I’m holding thumbs 🙏🏼
[2020/08/20, 13:28:16] Chloë: Guys guys guys, don't forget..... check in
[2020/08/20, 13:28:34] Chloë: I guess we're at the point at which we just need to do _something_
[2020/08/20, 13:29:07] Dino: Check in
[2020/08/20, 13:32:46] Bangie: All good on my side
[2020/08/20, 13:36:03] Philani: That would be the best news ever 🤞🏾
[2020/08/20, 13:36:20] Philani: Check in
[2020/08/20, 13:54:04] Jesse: Check in
[2020/08/21, 09:59:19] Chloë: Check in
[2020/08/21, 09:59:57] Chloë: We don't have too much time before the sprint ends, so if we don't hear anything from Pravesh (which seems very likely) what's the plan?
[2020/08/21, 10:02:52] Philani: I'm not too sure. I'm gonna work on the Taiga stuff and look at the coverage today, so we at least have that
[2020/08/21, 10:03:17] Chloë: Okay, let me know if you need any help with that
[2020/08/21, 10:03:43] Chloë: Since it's for the Java stuff 😬 and I also feel like I've done so little 😬😬😬
[2020/08/21, 10:03:57] Reece: Let’s meet today and sort out exactly what we’re gonna do
[2020/08/21, 10:04:11] Chloë: For sure
[2020/08/21, 10:04:23] Reece: Cause last meeting we were kinda just throwing around ideas
[2020/08/21, 10:05:11] Chloë: Since we thought we might still have a client 🙃
[2020/08/21, 10:07:42] Reece: Speaking of

[2020/08/21, 10:08:45] Chloë: If he's actually there 😂
[2020/08/21, 10:09:29] Dino: Hectic, he replied at 1am 😂😂
[2020/08/21, 10:09:39] Dino: I’m cool with that, I guess we kinda have to be
[2020/08/21, 10:10:09] Reece: What do you guys usually say when he says this? Should I ask him to create the meeting?
[2020/08/21, 10:11:00] Dino: Last time I created the meeting and then replied with the link. That way, we can all join earlier to discuss things and then he can join at a later stage - rather than us waiting for him to let us in like last time 😂
[2020/08/21, 10:11:59] Reece: Ayt
[2020/08/21, 10:12:59] Philani: I'm available.

[2020/08/21, 10:18:21] Bangie: I’m available but not for long , is that fine 🙈
[2020/08/21, 10:18:23] Reece: It’s a gamble on whether or not he’ll pitch
[2020/08/21, 10:18:53] Dino: Let’s meet at like 3:30, so even if he doesn’t pitch we can still discuss some shit?
[2020/08/21, 10:18:59] Reece: But even if he doesn’t we’ll just have our own meeting cause we need to in any event.
[2020/08/21, 10:19:54] Chloë: 👍🏼
[2020/08/21, 10:20:10] Reece: Awe chilled
[2020/08/21, 10:20:40] Reece: No problem Gulabjamun
[2020/08/21, 12:37:17] Jesse: Alrighty  im down to try this again if you guys are haha 😝
[2020/08/21, 13:43:54] Jesse: shit guys I can't make it for our meeting without pravesh I don't think :( Will only be around at about 4
[2020/08/21, 15:21:54] Reece: Running a little late bros I am apologize
[2020/08/21, 15:22:04] Reece: You can start without me
[2020/08/21, 15:31:51] Philani: I'll be 5 minutes also
[2020/08/21, 16:20:23] Jesse: crazy crazy
[2020/08/21, 16:20:27] Jesse: release on wednesday
[2020/08/21, 16:27:12] Chloë: Just checked, the Converter class is in the Java folder, so just send him that, and the Vertex, Edge, and Graph classes. JsonToObject isn't finished yet
[2020/08/21, 16:27:33] Dino: Awee ✌🏼
[2020/08/21, 16:28:09] Dino: Wait wait. The JsonToObject is in the folder, but I don’t see the converter class
[2020/08/21, 16:29:07] Dino: Lol nevermind
[2020/08/21, 16:29:42] Chloë: Yeah no I was just gonna send a screenshot 😂 cause I was wondering how it wasn't there when I was supposed to upload it like 2 weeks ago
[2020/08/21, 16:30:03] Chloë: I just deleted JsonToObject off there, I'll commit it again when it's done
[2020/08/21, 16:30:18] Chloë: But again, that's just a small update that we can save for another sprint
[2020/08/21, 16:33:51] Dino: Okay cool
[2020/08/21, 16:34:04] Dino: Do you rate I should mention that it doesn’t work well on Firefox?
‎[2020/08/21, 16:36:13] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/21, 16:36:41] Jesse: yea
[2020/08/21, 17:01:19] Chloë: Sure, that was just for testing
[2020/08/21, 17:15:34] Dino: Cool I sent it ✌🏼
[2020/08/21, 17:15:56] Chloë: Sweet
[2020/08/21, 17:42:56] Philani: Awe, thanks man 🙏🏾
[2020/08/23, 21:35:01] Jesse: hey guys
[2020/08/23, 21:35:32] Jesse: language must I do this aa lab in?
[2020/08/23, 21:35:42] Bangie: Java bro
[2020/08/23, 21:35:49] Jesse: ah okay
[2020/08/23, 21:35:57] Jesse: and then the graphs to be plotted?
[2020/08/23, 21:36:05] Jesse: can I just draw them and then take a picture
[2020/08/23, 21:36:47] Bangie: You just have to download the python graph generator and then create csv files with the data you get from your different inputs for your linear search algorithm
[2020/08/23, 21:45:36] Jesse: thanks bangie
[2020/08/23, 21:45:52] Jesse: so it seems they only want the csv files with the results submitted yeah?
[2020/08/23, 21:46:00] Jesse: They dont care about my code?
[2020/08/23, 21:46:30] Chloë: Yup, as far as I can see
[2020/08/23, 21:47:02] Jesse: hectic okay thank you guys
[2020/08/23, 21:47:49] Bangie: Yeah that’s weird 😂
[2020/08/23, 21:48:02] Bangie: You could legit put anything you want and they wouldn’t know you didn’t do the lab 😂
[2020/08/23, 21:50:23] Jesse: yeah
[2020/08/23, 21:50:25] Jesse: whack
[2020/08/23, 22:01:52] Reece: Bro I feel like these lab submissions aren’t for marks they’re kinda just to show that we did the lab
[2020/08/24, 00:08:51] Chloë: That's what it looks like, since he doesn't want the code
[2020/08/24, 09:56:54] Dino: Fuck guys I don’t know what went wrong but I gave pravesh the wrong graph generator folder, it’s a super old version
[2020/08/24, 09:59:03] Bangie: I’m sure he didn’t even open it as yet bro so you can send him the proper one
[2020/08/24, 09:59:43] Dino: Surely he must have though? It’s already Monday morning and he said he was gonna check it this weekend
[2020/08/24, 09:59:56] Dino: But it’s such an old version, I don’t even think it looks the same so he would’ve noticed
[2020/08/24, 10:07:55] Reece: Big L
[2020/08/24, 10:08:02] Reece: Did you email him and tell him
[2020/08/24, 10:08:12] Dino: Sent him a WhatsApp
[2020/08/24, 10:09:21] Reece: I feel like he didn’t look at it
[2020/08/24, 10:09:44] Reece: Cause I mean he would’ve noticed all the missing stuff and said something, surely
[2020/08/24, 10:09:49] Dino: Same hey...
[2020/08/24, 10:10:08] Dino: It’s only got one html file, not even the separate student and lecturer 😂
[2020/08/24, 10:23:34] Chloë: That is if he even checked 🤦🏽‍♀️
[2020/08/24, 10:25:39] Dino: This man blue ticked me, I’m sure he didn’t check it
[2020/08/24, 11:38:38] Dino: Please can someone send me a picture of what the shared folder looks like for you, I’ve just changed it
[2020/08/24, 11:43:26] Dino: Guys sorry for being annoying but ASAP please 😅😅
[2020/08/24, 12:29:17] Dino: Yooo people
[2020/08/24, 12:36:24] Jesse: sorry I was doing this lab
[2020/08/24, 12:36:34] Jesse: I'll check now
[2020/08/24, 12:36:50] Jesse: on github?
[2020/08/24, 12:36:57] Jesse: or where?
[2020/08/24, 12:37:17] Dino: Nah on google drive, I sent you guys an email on Friday with the link to the shared folder

[2020/08/24, 12:38:52] Dino: awe thank you ✌🏼
[2020/08/24, 12:39:02] Jesse: sure np
[2020/08/24, 13:12:30] Jesse: for the unique number of process created question did you guys count the original mother as a unique process
[2020/08/24, 13:12:45] Dino: I think so
[2020/08/24, 13:12:55] Jesse: k awe
[2020/08/24, 19:49:42] Chloë: Did anyone actually get an invite for our sprint retrospective?
[2020/08/24, 20:04:00] Bangie: Nope
[2020/08/24, 20:10:01] Dino: Negative. Seems a bit unfair
[2020/08/24, 20:10:05] Dino: Are we sorted for tomorrow?
[2020/08/24, 20:15:11] Reece: Negative
[2020/08/24, 20:15:35] Reece: Totally forgot we even had one
[2020/08/24, 20:23:59] Philani: I haven't gotten anything either.
[2020/08/24, 20:24:07] Philani: Yeah ✌🏾
[2020/08/24, 21:17:52] Jesse: the sprint is tomo?
[2020/08/24, 21:20:29] Chloë: Allegedly 🤷🏽‍♀️ if we don't get an invite, what do we even do?
[2020/08/24, 21:21:20] Jesse: Shit i'll finish the bfs stuff off in the morning either way, my bad
[2020/08/24, 21:22:01] Reece: Great question
[2020/08/24, 21:25:18] Dino: Dude don’t stress about that, I don’t think it’s too important
[2020/08/24, 21:25:27] Dino: We smile
[2020/08/24, 21:25:55] Bangie: We demand full marks for this retrospective 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2020/08/24, 21:25:55] Jesse: alright you sure?
[2020/08/24, 21:26:03] Jesse: 💪💪
[2020/08/24, 21:27:36] Reece: Yeah bro I don’t we included that in this sprint
[2020/08/24, 21:28:06] Reece: I just realized you weren’t there for our pre-meeting meeting on Friday
[2020/08/24, 21:33:02] Jesse: oh yea
[2020/08/24, 21:33:02] Jesse: fuck
[2020/08/24, 22:20:57] Dino: Lol
[2020/08/24, 22:21:02] Dino: But we got this
[2020/08/24, 22:21:07] Dino: We’ll try meet earlier than our sprint
[2020/08/25, 01:45:42] Dino: Nice we got an email now 🙃😂
[2020/08/25, 01:45:59] Bangie: Ayy 😂
[2020/08/25, 02:41:04] Dino: Let’s try meet at line 1:30?
[2020/08/25, 09:36:57] Bangie: Solid 👌
[2020/08/25, 10:00:58] Chloë: Should be good
[2020/08/25, 10:03:21] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/08/25, 10:29:23] Chloë: Small idea for the interface before I forget, it could be nice to have the option to add vertices in batches, like in a comma-separated list, instead of having to type and enter them one by one
[2020/08/25, 10:29:36] Jesse: Doope
[2020/08/25, 10:43:00] Chloë: The distance option for a vertex doesn't visibly change anything, also distance to what? For the MWST question type
[2020/08/25, 10:43:57] Chloë: Cause it doesn't have the option to pick two vertices and set the distance between them, it's just a "distance" property of a particular vertex
[2020/08/25, 10:50:02] Dino: Yeah that’s not a functional thing yet. It was for shortest path, just to help them keep track
[2020/08/25, 10:50:09] Dino: This would be awesome !
[2020/08/25, 10:50:48] Chloë: Okay cool, for now it's just _mentioned_ in the manual as vaguely as possible 😂 they won't be using that yet
[2020/08/25, 10:51:32] Dino: I think maybe actually rather take it out, we could always add it at a later stage 😂
[2020/08/25, 10:53:56] Reece: Less is more
[2020/08/25, 10:54:34] Chloë: Okay 😂
[2020/08/25, 11:36:46] Chloë: Question, is there a submission for this PC lab?
[2020/08/25, 11:37:11] Chloë: Cause if there isn't........ it's a future-me problem
[2020/08/25, 11:45:53] Dino: I don’t think so, well not yet at least 😏
[2020/08/25, 11:45:58] Bangie: I don’t think so
[2020/08/25, 11:46:19] Chloë: Not yet is what I needed to hear 😂
[2020/08/25, 11:46:20] Bangie: It’s just exercises to go through which might help in the next quiz
[2020/08/25, 11:46:34] Chloë: Which is this Thursday, right?
[2020/08/25, 11:46:46] Bangie: There’s an OS test on Friday but it lasts three weeks
[2020/08/25, 11:46:50] Bangie: I think so
[2020/08/25, 11:46:58] Chloë: Nice
[2020/08/25, 11:47:21] Bangie: So it’s basically like doing another tut but with everything 😂
[2020/08/25, 13:08:14] Dino: How much do we have to discuss? Should we rather meet at 13:45?
[2020/08/25, 13:08:49] Chloë: I don't imagine there's much hey, that'll probably be fine
[2020/08/25, 13:39:57] Reece: Man I wish I saw this earlier
[2020/08/25, 13:40:13] Reece: Skipped two red lights cause I thought I was late
[2020/08/25, 13:40:50] Dino: Well you still would’ve been late anyway so 😉
[2020/08/25, 13:41:49] Reece: As far as rebuttals go, I have none.
[2020/08/25, 13:46:07] Bangie: Teams or google meet ?
[2020/08/25, 13:46:19] Philani: Teams
[2020/08/25, 13:46:39] Jesse: 1 sec
[2020/08/25, 13:49:27] Dino: Fuck that guy it’s pronounced Dee-no
[2020/08/25, 14:01:08] Dino: Eish man I’m gonna laugh too much again
[2020/08/25, 14:01:25] Bangie: Ghosting us like Pravesh
[2020/08/25, 14:01:37] Dino: Reece 😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/25, 14:01:39] Chloë: _everyone is muted_
[2020/08/25, 14:01:45] Dino: Dead silent
[2020/08/25, 14:01:47] Philani: ‎This message was deleted.
[2020/08/25, 14:01:57] Chloë: fuck I'm already dying
[2020/08/25, 14:02:13] Dino: Even me 😂😂
[2020/08/25, 14:03:07] Chloë: cool cool cooooool
[2020/08/25, 14:05:49] Dino: Scroll
[2020/08/25, 14:05:54] Dino: Not too fast
[2020/08/25, 14:06:06] Dino: I’m joking 😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/25, 14:06:07] Reece: Someone open WhatsApp and delete any incriminating messages in the meantime
[2020/08/25, 14:06:13] Philani: 😂😂😂
[2020/08/25, 14:07:38] Chloë: Okay so what is the plan lmao
[2020/08/25, 14:07:45] Reece: Someone please
[2020/08/25, 14:07:52] Reece: I would but I can’t present on my phone
[2020/08/25, 14:08:03] Chloë: Oh okay
[2020/08/25, 14:08:22] Reece: Are you gonna do it Chloe
[2020/08/25, 14:09:03] Chloë: Ahhhhhhhhh okay
[2020/08/25, 14:09:24] Reece: Thank you 😂
[2020/08/25, 14:12:52] Chloë: Help MEEEEEEE
[2020/08/25, 14:13:06] Dino: Tell him we’re a friend group
[2020/08/25, 14:13:11] Dino: And we speak about other subjects
[2020/08/25, 14:13:15] Dino: And shit
[2020/08/25, 14:13:33] Chloë: Uploading it to Taiga isn't so bad though
[2020/08/25, 14:14:49] Chloë: We have literally never had to do this before thoughhhhhhhhhhh
[2020/08/25, 14:22:59] Reece: F
[2020/08/25, 14:23:01] Reece: F
[2020/08/25, 14:23:03] Reece: S
[2020/08/25, 14:23:14] Chloë: Oh well
[2020/08/25, 14:23:26] Chloë: I just hope this isn't ruining our marks for no good reason
[2020/08/25, 14:24:47] Philani: Nah I can't I'm finished 😂🙃
[2020/08/25, 14:25:34] Reece: It’s fine cause he had no clue what was happening 😂
[2020/08/25, 14:26:26] Dino: I’m so over this kak
[2020/08/25, 14:28:02] Chloë: Ja same hey
[2020/08/25, 14:28:28] Bangie: He didn’t understand one part of the code 😂
[2020/08/25, 14:28:37] Philani: Nah wtf. We've never used this shit about issues.
[2020/08/25, 14:28:48] Philani: For real 😂😂
[2020/08/25, 14:29:01] Chloë: Reece ftw
[2020/08/25, 14:29:24] Chloë: No one ever asked, Pierce didn't ask, it was literally never mentioned
[2020/08/25, 14:29:46] Chloë: Okay fair enough, if it's also just a new thing they asked the tutors about
[2020/08/25, 14:31:07] Chloë: LIE
[2020/08/25, 14:31:36] Bangie: If he didn’t do it why is he being such a stickler for the rules
[2020/08/25, 14:31:56] Reece: Ay bra whatever
[2020/08/25, 14:32:03] Reece: Not like we can lodge a complaint
[2020/08/25, 14:32:13] Chloë: Meh
[2020/08/25, 14:32:17] Reece: “Our tutor wants us to have everything on the rubric”
[2020/08/25, 14:32:44] Chloë: Yeah that's not exactly a valid complaint 🤣🤣🤣
[2020/08/25, 14:33:13] Chloë: 12 min left to mark
[2020/08/25, 14:37:51] Chloë: Ahhhhh what a lad
[2020/08/25, 14:37:54] Chloë: Nevermind
[2020/08/25, 14:38:26] Reece: Yeah man
[2020/08/25, 14:38:36] Reece: He Ayt
[2020/08/25, 14:45:27] Reece: Ayt let’s have a meeting tomorrow
[2020/08/25, 14:45:51] Reece: With or without Pravesh - I think we already know what we need to do
[2020/08/25, 16:06:17] Philani: Cool 👍🏾
‎[2020/08/26, 15:23:23] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/26, 15:23:39] Reece: 4 of us gotta go back
[2020/08/26, 15:26:45] Philani: 😂😂😂😂
[2020/08/26, 15:27:13] Philani: I really can't imagine going back to live classes before the year ends
[2020/08/26, 15:27:31] Reece: Yo y’all wanna have this meeting or what my guys
[2020/08/26, 15:27:59] Reece: I know Chlo Chlo has something at 4 so we could do 5 ?
[2020/08/26, 15:28:50] Reece: Absolutely no point at this point
[2020/08/26, 15:29:22] Chloë: 🤣🤣🤣
[2020/08/26, 15:30:27] Chloë: I might be like 5 min but yes that'd work for me
[2020/08/26, 15:31:54] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/08/26, 15:32:28] Chloë: Don't you guys have that meeting with Pravesh though? Or did he never respond
[2020/08/26, 15:35:11] Reece: Fuck knows
[2020/08/26, 15:56:02] Dino: Didn’t he send the link on the chat the other day? Did anyone save it?😅😂
[2020/08/26, 16:09:05] Reece: Yoh fuck
[2020/08/26, 16:09:15] Reece: Big L
[2020/08/26, 16:10:28] Reece: Guys I know I’m the one that said we should have a meeting and so I’m a twat for this ... but can we do it tomorrow? 😂
[2020/08/26, 16:10:57] Dino: 😂😂 I’d rather do it on Friday then, tomorrow I’m gonna be focusing on PC
[2020/08/26, 16:12:30] Reece: You see the reason I wanted to get it done today was cause I’m busy the entire weekend
[2020/08/26, 16:12:58] Reece: But tbh I don’t think there’s a rush maybe we could do Monday?
[2020/08/26, 16:13:19] Reece: I don’t see anyone working on anything this weekend since apparently block end
[2020/08/26, 16:13:23] Dino: Eish that’s leaving it late
[2020/08/26, 16:13:36] Dino: I’ll more likely work on it this weekend than next week
[2020/08/26, 16:14:59] Reece: Tomorrow
[2020/08/26, 16:15:02] Reece: Half an hour
[2020/08/26, 16:15:06] Reece: In and out
[2020/08/26, 16:15:10] Reece: No socializing
[2020/08/26, 16:15:13] Reece: Final offer
[2020/08/26, 16:16:48] Bangie: Awe we can do it but let’s either do it in the morning or late afternoon
[2020/08/26, 16:17:03] Dino: 😴😴 yeah that’s chilled
[2020/08/26, 16:22:28] Dino: So we just not gonna bother with Pravesh today?😂
[2020/08/26, 16:35:59] Reece: I doubt he remembers
[2020/08/26, 16:36:03] Reece: But if he does
[2020/08/26, 16:36:12] Reece: Now he’ll know how it feels
‎[2020/08/26, 16:36:22] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/08/26, 16:36:28] Dino: Wow hey 😂😂
[2020/08/26, 16:36:38] Bangie: Anyone gonna do the PC quiz early 😂
[2020/08/26, 18:27:09] Chloë: I see he dipped on us again 🙃
[2020/08/26, 18:35:08] Philani: I think he's so flaky cause he's probably not actually gonna use it. I was thinking cause Londani said his group did the exact same thing last year, but we never used any bit of it in AA or even tried 😂
[2020/08/26, 19:30:15] Dino: That will be so deep hey 😂
[2020/08/26, 19:30:36] Chloë: I wouldn't be that surprised
[2020/08/26, 20:01:32] Reece: I was thinking the same thing when he said it
[2020/08/26, 20:01:42] Reece: Maybe dude has been playing us this whole time
[2020/08/26, 21:34:40] Dino: You guys rate? That will really suck 🥺 we should ask pravesh 😂
[2020/08/27, 15:15:12] Dino: Are we gonna have a meeting today?
[2020/08/27, 15:35:28] Philani: Eish guys I'm not gonna lie, with preparing for this quiz and my general fatigue, my brain is genuinely fried for a meeting 😅
[2020/08/27, 15:37:50] Dino: 😂😂😂 nah I feel you
[2020/08/27, 15:37:56] Dino: I’m chilled with next week to be honest
[2020/08/27, 15:44:51] Reece: Monday it is 👍🏾
[2020/08/31, 09:50:42] Dino: So today?😅😴
[2020/08/31, 10:49:21] Philani: I can do 3 for today 👍🏾
[2020/08/31, 11:12:45] Chloë: I should be able to as well
[2020/08/31, 11:27:03] Reece: 👍🏾
[2020/08/31, 12:55:52] Chloë: The next retrospective is only on the 15th I think, meaning they basically gave us a week off/extra anyway. We should be sorted for time after our meeting today
[2020/08/31, 12:56:33] Dino: For sure ⚡️
[2020/08/31, 14:59:27] Chloë: Teams?
[2020/08/31, 15:00:23] Jesse: Shit, I like just woke up
[2020/08/31, 15:00:43] Jesse: My bad
[2020/08/31, 15:00:53] Jesse: Can i get teams on my phone?
[2020/08/31, 15:01:01] Dino: Yebo ✌🏼
[2020/08/31, 15:01:04] Dino: Yeah
[2020/08/31, 15:01:09] Jesse: K sick
[2020/08/31, 15:01:31] Chloë: Cool cool cool be there in a sec
‎[2020/09/04, 11:03:24] Reece: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/04, 11:03:51] Reece: i.e. today at 4:30
[2020/09/04, 11:04:48] Reece: I don’t even want to make time cause I just know he’ll flop us 😂
[2020/09/04, 11:47:34] Philani: Lol 😂 I should be able to make it 👍🏾
[2020/09/04, 12:28:57] Dino: Sorry guys I’m not 😂🙈
[2020/09/04, 12:30:55] Bangie: Me too 🙈
[2020/09/04, 12:31:29] Chloë: Same hey, I was gonna say that you guys could probably meet without me but it seems like almost everyone can't make it
[2020/09/04, 12:31:34] Reece: What I’m hearing is
[2020/09/04, 12:31:38] Reece: We ghost Pravesh
[2020/09/04, 12:31:56] Reece: Jk I’ll tell him we can’t make it
[2020/09/04, 12:40:02] Dino: We should’ve man
[2020/09/04, 12:41:00] Reece: Fight fire with fire and we all burn to death
[2020/09/04, 12:42:51] Dino: Wisdom from the Dalai Lama himself
[2020/09/04, 12:42:58] Dino: But yes that is true 😂🙏🏼
[2020/09/05, 13:44:23] Reece: Guys Pravesh wants to meet on Monday at 4
[2020/09/05, 13:44:29] Reece: Everyone good with that?
[2020/09/05, 13:46:12] Bangie: I’m fine with that
[2020/09/05, 14:22:07] Chloë: I have my usual obligations at 4, but that shouldn't matter too much
[2020/09/05, 14:22:31] Chloë: Jesse knows strictly more than what I know
[2020/09/05, 15:14:47] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/09/05, 22:45:20] Dino: Yebo
[2020/09/07, 13:48:06] Reece: Guys
[2020/09/07, 13:48:47] Reece: I uh- I may have forgotten to reply to Pravesh’s email
[2020/09/07, 14:28:20] Dino: Reece
[2020/09/07, 14:28:21] Dino: Eish
[2020/09/07, 14:28:32] Dino: Let us know if he replies
[2020/09/07, 14:35:00] Reece: Yeah man my bad 😂
[2020/09/07, 14:35:37] Reece: I was waiting for you and Jesse to confirm and by the time you did I had totally spaced

[2020/09/07, 14:40:46] Dino: Awee 😂✌🏼
[2020/09/07, 14:41:54] Reece: This doesn’t mean he replied btw I created this link 😂
[2020/09/07, 14:42:09] Reece: Doubt he will tbh
[2020/09/07, 15:16:53] Philani: @27794187505 could you please log onto Travis CI using Github and connect our repo when you have time. I've uploaded the one file to Github so it should build automatically ✌🏾
[2020/09/07, 15:17:28] Chloë: Lmao
[2020/09/07, 15:17:28] Dino: Sure ✌🏼
[2020/09/07, 15:18:40] Chloë: I'll be back again after 5:30
[2020/09/07, 15:20:48] Dino: I’ve connected it but it doesn’t seem to be building
[2020/09/07, 15:22:12] Philani: That's weird. I'll have another look at it. Thanks for connecting it though. I should be good from here ✌🏾
[2020/09/07, 15:22:24] Bangie: Are all the travis setup files on the repo bro
[2020/09/07, 15:39:53] Philani: Yeah I fixed them ✌🏾
[2020/09/07, 15:39:56] Philani: Cool it's building and passing the tests now ✌🏾
[2020/09/07, 16:09:57] Dino: Are we not having a meeting?
[2020/09/07, 16:33:11] Reece: Got an email from Pravesh at ten past asking if we were still available
[2020/09/07, 16:33:19] Reece: I’m guessing he figured not 😂
[2020/09/07, 16:35:36] Reece: Asked him if we can do tomorrow
[2020/09/07, 16:58:15] Dino: Sweet
[2020/09/07, 17:41:52] Chloë: Hectic 😂 again, I'm not available at 4 tomorrow but I'll be around after 5. Do you guys want to have a group meeting tomorrow after that as well?
[2020/09/07, 17:47:51] Reece: Sounds like a plan
[2020/09/08, 15:28:22] Dino: I might be 10 mins late
[2020/09/08, 15:29:51] Jesse: Shit guys im struggling to get home
[2020/09/08, 15:32:40] Reece: We’re gonna do it after 5 so Chloe can join right?
[2020/09/08, 15:32:58] Bangie: Yeah that’s what I though 😂
[2020/09/08, 15:33:17] Reece: So everyone just check in by then and if everyone’s here we’ll have the meeting
[2020/09/08, 15:37:46] Dino: Wait but don’t we have a meeting with pravesh at 4?
[2020/09/08, 15:38:25] Reece: On account of the fact that he hasn’t replied
[2020/09/08, 15:38:28] Reece: Imma say no
[2020/09/08, 15:39:20] Dino: Eish for real fuck man 😂
[2020/09/08, 16:24:50] Dino: What time? 5:30?
[2020/09/08, 16:28:55] Reece: I can do 5:30
[2020/09/08, 16:46:31] Philani: 👍🏾
[2020/09/08, 17:08:53] Chloë: Yeah lol fuck it's looking tight for 5:30 even 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣 you can start without me though and I'll come as soon as I can
[2020/09/08, 17:11:11] Reece: Maybe we just do tomorrow?
[2020/09/08, 17:11:20] Reece: Cause it looks like Jesse is MIA too
[2020/09/08, 17:11:44] Dino: Eish guys we can’t keep delaying this 😂
[2020/09/08, 17:11:44] Chloë: I have the same 4pm obligations but I can do earlier for sure
[2020/09/08, 17:13:36] Reece: Yeah let’s do it first thing tomorrow

[2020/09/11, 15:31:28] Philani: now*
[2020/09/11, 15:31:34] Bangie: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2020/09/11, 15:35:00] Dino: 😂😂
[2020/09/11, 15:35:09] Dino: I love how he didn’t even tell us 😂
[2020/09/11, 15:35:35] Chloë: Lol he really did it 😂🌈
[2020/09/11, 15:53:35] Bangie: Guys although we not done , I just want to say well done to everyone and it’s been a fucking pleasure working with you guys (mind my language)
[2020/09/11, 15:54:48] Dino: Couldn’t agree more 🙏🏼 this has been such an awesome team and it makes me so proud to see our hard work paying off 😍
‎[2020/09/11, 20:16:19] Dino: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/11, 20:19:34] Chloë: No problem guys 🙈 thanks Dino
[2020/09/11, 20:48:30] Dino: Philani could you please send through the user stories that we decided on during the meeting?🙈 even just a pic or anything, I just might wanna make some changes before you add it to taiga 😂🙏🏼
[2020/09/11, 20:58:44] Philani: Yeah, it's been great guys 🙏🏾
‎[2020/09/11, 20:59:42] Philani: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/11, 21:02:35] Dino: Okay so I rate split number 5:
1) Select edge by clicking on it, which enables the user to delete it by clicking the delete button, and update it by changing the value - something like that 
2) Same thing but for vertex.

Because even though they’re similar functions they’re completely different implementations so it seems like a waste to make it one, because it really was a lot of work and separate stuff
[2020/09/11, 21:02:59] Dino: And then remove number 6 because I’m not gonna get the chance to do that for this sprint, and then we can use it for the next sprint ✌🏼
[2020/09/11, 21:03:13] Dino: Maybe change the wording a bit so it seems like a very different task 😂
[2020/09/11, 21:08:57] Philani: Okay sick. I'll do all of that when I get to it. Thanks for the feedback ✌🏾
[2020/09/11, 21:12:04] Dino: Sweet thanks man 😇✌🏼

[2020/09/14, 16:14:37] Philani: Just working on some stuff and will upload everything tonight
[2020/09/14, 16:21:42] Bangie: There’s currently a WhatsApp text file should I remove it and add the most current one tomorrow ?
[2020/09/14, 16:25:41] Dino: It’s gonna have to have a lot of editing though 🙈
[2020/09/14, 16:33:55] Bangie: Yeah that’s horrible 😂
[2020/09/14, 16:50:46] Philani: Maybe we can have a meeting tomorrow before to just make sure everything is fine.
[2020/09/14, 17:02:33] Chloë: Did we ever get an invite for the retrospective tomorrow?
[2020/09/14, 17:10:30] Philani: We did not 😅
[2020/09/14, 17:10:48] Chloë: Big oof
[2020/09/14, 17:11:31] Chloë: I'm working on the assumption that it'll be at 2pm again
[2020/09/14, 17:15:05] Reece: Guys how long did SD lab 3 take you
[2020/09/14, 17:15:25] Dino: OS?

[2020/09/14, 17:15:43] Dino: Yeah well between 2 and 5 I guess 😂
[2020/09/14, 17:16:29] Dino: Not extremely long but it wasn’t short 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2020/09/14, 17:16:39] Dino: You’ll be able to finish by the time it’s due though
[2020/09/14, 17:18:23] Dino: I rate ✌🏼
[2020/09/14, 17:20:03] Reece: I have to go out for supper now it’s my moms birthday 😂
[2020/09/14, 17:20:16] Reece: So I wanna know if I’ll have enough time when I get back
[2020/09/14, 17:20:23] Dino: Have you started?😂
[2020/09/14, 17:20:27] Reece: Negative
[2020/09/14, 17:20:42] Philani: I think you'll be able to finish it
[2020/09/14, 17:20:49] Dino: If you’re only gonna get home at like 10 then it might be a bit of a push, but I back it
[2020/09/14, 17:21:24] Reece: Awe
[2020/09/14, 17:21:46] Reece: Seconded

Just export it because it’s going to take long to edit it
[2020/09/15, 09:19:06] Dino: Yeah don’t stress Ive noticed this 😂✌🏼
[2020/09/15, 09:19:10] Dino: We’ll make it an issue for now
[2020/09/15, 09:19:57] Chloë: Yeah no lol I told them, it's a known issue but also not like a _fatal_ issue right now
[2020/09/15, 09:22:56] Bangie: It’s probably just a Boolean fix
[2020/09/15, 10:10:57] Bangie: I mean I doubt he’ll read it properly
